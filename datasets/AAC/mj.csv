"In a study for the Cato Institute , Jeffrey A.

"Miron and Waldock also estimate that in 2008 , states across the country spent a total of $ 25.7-billion on drug prohibition ( net of seizures and fines ) .",['NATIONAL_BUDGET']
"For instance , in 1999 , close to 60,000 prisoners ( 3.3 % of the total incarcerated population ) convicted of violating marijuana laws were behind bars at a cost to taxpayers of some $ 1.2 billion per year .",['NATIONAL_BUDGET']
There is certainly a financial and human cost to keeping marijuana illegal and we can see it in our prisons .,['NATIONAL_BUDGET']
The social costs of the marijuana laws are vast .,['COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS']
"Despite claims to the contrary , the social costs of legalizing marijuana will dwarf the meager taxes raised .","['COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS', 'NATIONAL_BUDGET']"
"Also , that marijuana legalization would yield tax revenue of $ 2.4 billion annually if it were taxed like all other goods and $ 6.2 billion annually if it were taxed at rates comparable to those on alcohol and tobacco .",['NATIONAL_BUDGET']
"Within the first 10 months , the sales of marijuana have resulted in nearly $ 40 million in tax revenue .",['NATIONAL_BUDGET']
"According to press reports , supporters of the California initiative estimate that about $ 15-billion worth of marijuana is sold every year in the state – thus , an excise tax on the retail sales of marijuana would likely raise at least $ 1.3 billion a year in revenue .",['NATIONAL_BUDGET']
"Indeed , the potential financial gains to be realized through the legalization of drugs would be of particular interest to the state of California , which not only teems with thousands of ( illegal ) marijuana growers , but whose state government also faces a budget shortfall of nearly $ 20-billion for fiscal 2011 .",['NATIONAL_BUDGET']
"Approximately $ 8.7 billion of this revenue would result from the legalization of marijuana , $ 32.6 billion from legalization of cocaine and heroin , and $ 5.5 billion from legalization of all other drugs .",['NATIONAL_BUDGET']

There is reason even for people who oppose the use of marijuana to support its legalization : legal substances can be controlled in ways illegal ones can not .,['DRUG_POLICY']
"Although those who oppose the legalization of marijuana have every reason to believe that further , legitimate scientific research will confirm the dangers of its use , no side should try to thwart the sober judgment of the national legislature and sister states .",['HARM']
Theoretical arguments in favor of marijuana legalization usually overlook the practical matter of how the drug would be regulated and sold .,['DRUG_POLICY']
A common argument for legalization is that smoking marijuana is no more dangerous than drinking alcohol and that prohibiting the use of marijuana is therefore no more justified than the prohibition of alcohol .,['LEGAL_DRUGS']
Most people talk about legalizing pot as if it were no worse than alcohol -- as if no one has ever died as the result of using marijuana .,['LEGAL_DRUGS']
"I get concerns that the impact of legalized pot will be heaviest on poorer neighborhoods , and the fear of edibles , and of increasing drug use in general .",['COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS']

"When you run around telling kids not to do drugs , young kids , and then they read that we might legalize marijuana , I just think it ' s a mixed message .",['CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY']
