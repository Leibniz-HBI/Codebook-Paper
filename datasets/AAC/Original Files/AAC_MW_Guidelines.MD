# Aspect Annotation in short argumentative text units.
The task is to find the aspect of an argumentative sentence or short text unit.
An aspect in this task is defined as a sub-topic of discourse in the broader
topic of the debate about minimum wage. Several aspects are further defined
below. The terms which are indicative of the presence of a particular aspect
used in argument are to be labeled with the coresponding aspect.

General statements of facts or opinions which are not further explained should
be labeled as `OTHER`. Please mark the first word as the aspect term. Generally,
try to mark as little terms as necessary to identify an aspect. It is possible,
that more than one aspect is present in a sentence, please mark all applicable
aspects.

Below, the aspect categories are further explained. Bulletpoints explain the
categories in detail. The list of words below the bulletpoints give some terms
which are often found as aspect terms or in sentences containing the aspect.
**Note:** Always read the entire sentence and assess which aspect is argued
about. A given word might be indicative for an aspect but can still be in
sentences where the aspect is not argued about.
