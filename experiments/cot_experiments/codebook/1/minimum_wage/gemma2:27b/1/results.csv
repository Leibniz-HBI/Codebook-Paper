"Let's analyze the text for appropriate labeling: 

The sentence states: ""In other words, minimum-wage work is not just supplemental; many households are relying either fully or substantially on full-time, minimum-wage work to pay the bills.""


**Reasoning:**

1. **Emphasis on Primary Income Source:** The phrase ""many households are relying either fully or substantially on full-time, minimum-wage work"" emphasizes that for these households, the minimum wage job is not a secondary source of income but their primary means of financial support.

2.  **Household Dependence:** The text explicitly mentions ""households,"" highlighting the broader impact of minimum wage earnings on families and their ability to cover essential expenses like bills.

"Let's analyze the text: ""Raising minimum wage means some of these people would be able to better support themselves without leaning as heavily on social programs and this would ultimately mean lower taxes or a reallocation of those funds to support other needs.""

**Reasoning:**

1. **Reduced Reliance on Social Programs:** The sentence highlights how a minimum wage increase could enable individuals to ""better support themselves without leaning as heavily on social programs"". This directly connects the issue of minimum wage to the broader context of social welfare and government spending.

2. **Highlighting Economic Dependence:** By stating that the ""typical minimum wage worker is not... earning weekend pocket money,""  the text emphasizes that these individuals rely on their wages for essential living expenses, suggesting they are adults rather than students.

3. **Implied Consequences**:  The argument implies consequences for both employers (who may struggle to find affordable labor) and low-skilled workers (who may face job losses).

"Let's analyze why the text aligns with the label ""LIVING_WAGE"":

1. **Focus on Wage Adequacy:** The sentence explicitly mentions ""the proposed increased wage to $15 will provide a living wage."" This directly addresses the concept of a wage sufficient to meet an individual's basic needs.

1. **""Purchase Less"":** The sentence explicitly states that raising the minimum wage would make poor consumers worse off because they ""can purchase less."" 
2. **Direct Impact:** This impact is described as ""in a direct sense,"" meaning it directly relates to their ability to buy goods and services with their income.

Purchasing power refers to the amount of goods and services that can be bought with a unit of currency.

2. **Impact on Pricing Strategy:**  The phrase ""...they have to raise their prices or they have to cut costs"" directly addresses how businesses react to increased expenses. Raising prices is a common strategy to offset higher input costs.

1. **Focus on Teenagers:** The text explicitly mentions ""teenagers"" withdrawing from the labor force in response to a minimum wage increase. 
2. **Implied Skill Level:** While not directly stating skill level, teenagers are often associated with entry-level or unskilled jobs.  The argument revolves around how a higher minimum wage might incentivize them to leave these positions.
3. **Supply and Demand Dynamics:** The reference to ""simple supply and demand diagram"" further suggests an analysis of the labor market where teenagers represent a segment with potentially lower skill requirements compared to more specialized roles. 

Therefore, given the context of teenagers leaving the workforce and the discussion on basic supply and demand principles,  **SKILLED LABOR** is a fitting label.
