"Let's break down why **ECONOMIC_GROWTH** is the most suitable label for this text: 

1. **Stimulation of Consumption:** The text states that a minimum wage ""stimulates consumption"" – this directly relates to the concept of increasing consumer spending, a key driver of economic growth.
2. **Increased Spending Power:**  The phrase ""allowing low-paid workers to spend more"" highlights how a higher minimum wage would put more disposable income in the hands of consumers. This increased spending power can lead to higher demand for goods and services, fueling economic activity.

Therefore, the argument presented focuses on how a minimum wage increase can contribute to **ECONOMIC_GROWTH**.

""Minimum wage should be unlivable, so the people making it are motivated to do something better!""

**Reasons for choosing ""WAGE_INEQUALITY""**:


1. **Direct Mention:** The text explicitly states that ""the declining value of the minimum wage is one of the primary causes of wage inequality between low- and middle-income workers."" This directly links the minimum wage discussion to the broader issue of wage disparities.

2. **Focus on Impact:**  The passage argues that a higher minimum wage would help address this inequality, further reinforcing its relevance to the topic.

3. **Economic Context:** The mention of ""a majority of Americans...support increasing the minimum wage"" highlights the socio-economic implications and potential solutions for bridging the wage gap.

"Let's break down why the label **LIVING_WAGE** is appropriate for this text:

* **""Proposed increased wage to $15 will provide a living wage""**: This sentence directly states that the purpose of the wage increase is to achieve a ""living wage."" 

The term ""living wage"" implies a level of income sufficient to cover essential needs like housing, food, and healthcare. Therefore, the correct label is **LIVING_WAGE**.

"Let's break down why ""ECONOMIC_IMPACTS"" is the best label for this text:

1. **Focus on Side Effects:** The sentence highlights ""potentially detrimental side effects"" of raising the minimum wage. This indicates a concern about broader economic consequences rather than specific social or political issues.

2. **Specific Examples:** The text provides examples of these side effects, such as ""job reduction"" and ""a rise in the cost of consumer goods and services."" These are classic economic indicators often discussed in debates about minimum wage policy.

3. **Implied Causality:** The phrasing suggests a causal relationship between raising the minimum wage and the listed side effects.  This further reinforces the focus on economic outcomes.

"Let's analyze why the label **CONSUMER_SPENDING** is appropriate for this text:

1. **Impact on Purchasing Power:** The sentence focuses on how raising the minimum wage ""makes poor consumers worse off in a direct sense, in that they can purchase less with their earnings."" This directly addresses the effect on consumer spending power.
2. **Consumer Welfare:**  The core concern is about the well-being of ""poor consumers"" and how policy changes affect their ability to buy goods and services.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Specific Industry Impact:** The sentence focuses on the potential effects of a minimum wage increase on the ""fast food industry"". 
2. **Profit Margins as Metric:** It cites a study analyzing the impact on ""profit margins"", a key financial indicator for businesses.
3. **Limited Impact Conclusion:**  The text states that the wage increase would have ""little to no impact"" on profit margins, suggesting an economic analysis within the context of a specific sector.

"Let's break down why the label **MINIMUM_WAGE_POLICY** is most fitting for this text:

1. **Direct Focus on Minimum Wage Laws:** The sentence explicitly mentions ""Minimum wage laws""  and discusses specific proposals like indexing the minimum wage to average wages.

2. **Policy Goal:** The text highlights the potential benefits of these proposals, namely keeping the ""dollar value of the minimum wage relevant and predictable."" This demonstrates a concern with the design and effectiveness of minimum wage policy itself.

""“If a business has to pay more for anything, gasoline, produce, labor — they have to raise their prices or they have to cut costs, plain and simple,” says Tom Scarda, a Certified Franchise Consultant."" 

**Reasoning:**

1. **Business Costs and Responses:** The statement focuses on how increased costs (in this case, labor) force businesses to make decisions like raising prices or cutting costs. This directly relates to the concepts of inflation and cost management within an economy.
2. **Expert Opinion:** The quote comes from Tom Scarda, a Certified Franchise Consultant, lending credibility to the economic principles being discussed.

"Let's break down why the label **SKILLED_LABOR** is appropriate for this text: 

1. **Focus on Teenagers:** The sentence specifically mentions ""teenagers"" withdrawing from the labor force in response to minimum wage increases. 

2. **Implied Skill Level:** While not explicitly stated, teenagers are often associated with entry-level or less skilled jobs. The text suggests that these teenagers may possess limited skills and are more sensitive to wage changes than older, more experienced workers.

1. **Price Increases:** The sentence explicitly states that businesses might ""have to raise prices"" as a consequence of raising wages. This directly relates to the concept of inflation, which is the general increase in prices of goods and services over time.
2. **Maintaining Profits:** The phrase ""to maintain their profits"" further emphasizes the connection to inflation. Businesses facing higher labor costs are likely to pass those costs onto consumers through price increases, potentially contributing to inflationary pressures.

1. **Challenge to Free Market Ideology:** The sentence directly contradicts the idea of a perfectly functioning ""free market"" by stating it's a ""myth."" This implies that market forces alone are insufficient to ensure worker well-being.
2. **Emphasis on Worker Protection:**  The phrase ""take care of workers"" highlights a concern for the welfare and fair treatment of employees, suggesting a need for intervention beyond solely relying on market mechanisms.

Therefore, the statement aligns with the concept of **MARKET_FAILURES** – situations where the free market doesn't produce desirable social outcomes and may require government intervention or regulations to address inequalities or protect vulnerable groups like workers.

2. **""Bottom Line"" Focus:**  The phrase ""maintain their bottom line"" highlights the financial pressure businesses face. Cutting jobs or reducing hours are common cost-cutting measures that impact employment levels.
