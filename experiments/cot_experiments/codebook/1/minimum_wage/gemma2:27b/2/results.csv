1. **Moral Authority:** The statement originates from ""US Catholic Bishops,"" lending it a strong ethical and moral weight.
2. **Prioritization of Labor:**  The phrase ""WHICH TAKES PRIORITY OVER ANY CLAIMS OF THE OWNERS TO PROFITS"" explicitly establishes a hierarchy of rights, placing the needs of labor above those seeking profit. 
3. **""Respect the Right to a Living Wage"":** This statement directly connects the concept of fairness and ethical treatment of workers with the fundamental right to earn a sufficient wage for survival.

"Let's analyze why the label **LABOR_MARKET_RIGIDITIES** fits this text:

1. **Focus on Legal Restrictions:** The sentence highlights legal restrictions imposed on both employers (minimum wage) and workers (ability to work in a protected sector).

2. **Implication of Reduced Flexibility:** The comparison between these restrictions implies that both situations limit the flexibility of the labor market. Employers are prevented from hiring at lower wages, while workers face barriers to entry if they cannot find employers willing to pay the minimum wage.

3. **Concept of Market Equilibrium:**  The text alludes to the idea that setting a minimum wage disrupts the natural equilibrium of supply and demand in the labor market. This is a core concept within discussions of labor market rigidities.

"Let's break down why the label **INFLATION** is appropriate for this text:

1. **""Staying the same""**: The phrase emphasizes that the nominal value of the minimum wage remains constant.
2. **""Actually becomes worth a little bit less""**: This crucial statement highlights the eroding purchasing power of the minimum wage over time.  This decrease in real value is a direct result of inflation.

Inflation reduces the buying power of money, meaning what you could purchase yesterday with a certain amount of money will cost more today. Therefore, even if the nominal minimum wage stays the same, its ability to buy goods and services diminishes due to **inflation**.

1. **Focus on Consumer Purchasing Power:** The sentence explicitly states that ""poor consumers"" are negatively impacted because they ""can purchase less with their earnings."" This directly addresses the effect of a policy (implied, likely minimum wage increase) on consumer ability to buy goods and services.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Specific Wage Increase:** The text mentions a concrete example of a wage increase: ""$7.25/hour to $15/hour"".
2. **Impact on Profit Margins:**  The core focus is on the effect of this wage hike on ""the fast food industry's profit margins.""

1. **Direct Subject:** The sentence explicitly focuses on ""minimum wage laws"" and discusses a specific policy proposal – indexing the minimum wage to average wages.
2. **Policy Objectives:**  The text highlights the potential benefits of this policy, namely keeping the minimum wage ""relevant and predictable."" This emphasizes the discussion of policy mechanics and goals.

2. **""Plain and Simple"" Emphasis:** The speaker's use of the phrase ""plain and simple"" emphasizes the fundamental economic principle at play: businesses facing higher costs will often pass those on to consumers through price increases.

"Let's break down why **LABOR_SUPPLY** is the most fitting label for this text:

1. **Focus on Teenagers:** The text specifically mentions ""teenagers"" withdrawing from the labor force in response to a minimum wage increase. This highlights a change in the *supply* of labor, particularly among a specific demographic.
2. **Withdrawal Implies Reduced Supply:** The phrase ""teenagers withdrew from the labor force"" directly indicates a decrease in the number of people willing and able to work at a given wage level – a key aspect of labor supply.
3. **Contrast with Demand:** The text contrasts this reduction in *supply* with potential changes in *demand* for labor, suggesting an analysis of how both sides of the labor market equation are affected.

3. **Consumer Impact Considered:**  The statement ""without scaring off customers"" suggests that Burger King and McDonald's are considering the potential impact of price increases on consumer demand, demonstrating their adaptation to market conditions.

2. **Reference to Productivity Gains:**  Mentioning ""greater productivity"" since the 1970s emphasizes that despite increased economic output, the benefits haven't proportionally reached workers.

3. **Implication of Inequality:** The phrase ""less... going towards workers"" strongly suggests a widening gap between those who own capital (businesses) and those who provide labor.
