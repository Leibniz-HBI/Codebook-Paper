"Let's break down the reasoning for labeling this text as **ECONOMIC_GROWTH**:

1. **Stimulates Consumption**: The sentence mentions that supporters of minimum wage believe it ""stimulates consumption"". This implies an increase in economic activity.
2. **Money into the Economy**: The phrase ""puts more money into the economy"" further supports the idea of increased economic activity, specifically through spending.
3. **Effect on Low-Paid Workers**: The text specifies that low-paid workers will be able to spend more due to a higher minimum wage, indicating a focus on how this policy affects the broader economy by empowering consumers (low-paid workers).
4. **Implicit Connection to Growth**: The idea of increased consumption and money flowing into the economy is closely tied to economic growth.

"It seems like you provided multiple text samples but only one was analyzed. I'll provide a step-by-step analysis for each sample and identify the correct label.

**Sample 1:**
About 70 percent of minimum wage employees , however , work fewer than 35 hours per week and thus earn proportionately less , according to federal labor statistics .

**Label:** **YOUTH_AND_SECONDARY_WAGE_EARNERS**

Reasoning:

1. The sentence highlights that ""About 70 percent of minimum wage employees... work fewer than 35 hours per week."" This is a key indicator often associated with part-time employment.
2. The phrase ""and thus earn proportionately less"" reinforces the idea that these workers are likely not relying on their minimum wage job as their primary source of income.
3. The reference to ""federal labor statistics"" suggests a broader analysis of employment patterns, which often differentiate between full-time and part-time workers.

These points collectively point towards a workforce segment that is more characteristic of `YOUTH_AND_SECONDARY_WAGE_EARNERS` - individuals who might be working part-time jobs for supplemental income or experience rather than as their primary means of support.

**Sample 2:**
That last argument is underscored by the exorbitant salaries earned by CEOs and other corporate titans , which are also the same people generally arguing against an increase in the minimum wage .

**Label:** **CAPITAL_VS_LABOR**

Reasoning:

1. The phrase ""exorbitant salaries earned by CEOs and other corporate titans"" highlights a significant disparity in income between high-level executives (representing capital) and average workers.
2. The sentence directly links those benefiting from high salaries (capital owners) to opposition towards policies that would improve the wages of workers (labor).
3. The text implicitly criticizes the power imbalance between capital and labor, suggesting that CEOs' resistance to a minimum wage hike stems from their desire to maintain this advantage.

**Sample 3:**
According to the Economic Policy Institute , the minimum wage in the United States would have been $ 18.28 in 2013 if the minimum wage had kept pace with labor productivity .

**Label:** **SOCIAL JUSTICE/INJUSTICE**

Reasoning:

1. The text highlights a discrepancy between the actual minimum wage and a hypothetical minimum wage that keeps pace with labor productivity, suggesting a discussion about fairness.
2. The phrase ""if the minimum wage had kept pace with labor productivity"" implies that workers are not receiving a fair share of the economic gains from increased productivity, pointing towards inequality.
3. Citing data from the Economic Policy Institute, which is known for its research on issues related to economic justice and worker rights, further strengthens the connection to social justice concerns.

**Sample 4:**
After the president ' s speech , House Speaker John Boehner argued that raising the minimum wage would raise unemployment .

**Label:** **UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE**

Reasoning:

1. The sentence explicitly mentions the potential impact of raising the minimum wage on ""unemployment.""
2. The argument presented by John Boehner directly links an increase in the minimum wage to a rise in unemployment, establishing a clear cause-and-effect relationship within the context of the `UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE` aspect.

**Sample 5:**
Myth : Increasing the minimum wage is bad for the economy .

**Label:** **ECONOMIC_IMPACT**

Reasoning:

1. The statement directly addresses the impact of increasing the minimum wage ""on the economy"".
2. This aligns with the definition of the `ECONOMIC_IMPACT` aspect in the codebook, which emphasizes the effects of minimum wage on the economy as a whole.
3. The phrase ""bad for the economy"" suggests a discussion about broader economic consequences, rather than specific aspects like unemployment or business challenges.

**Sample 6:**
-SKILLED Raising the wage will make it more expensive to hire younger and low-skill workers .

**Label:** **LABOR_COST**

Reasoning:

1. The sentence highlights that raising the minimum wage would increase labor costs for employers.
2. The phrase ""make it more expensive to hire"" directly addresses the economic impact of higher wages on businesses.

1. **Historical Context:** The text references a historical minimum wage, implying a discussion about economic systems and how they have evolved over time.
2. **Income Inequality:** The comparison of past wages to current dollars ($10.95 in 1968 vs. the current discussion on raising the minimum wage) suggests an analysis of income inequality and its implications for society.
3. **Power Dynamics:** The text does not explicitly discuss power dynamics, but it provides context that is often associated with discussions about capital and labor, such as understanding how economic policies affect different groups in society.

**ECONOMIC_IMPACT**

1. **Historical Wage Data:** The text presents historical wage data, which is often used to analyze the impact of economic policies or decisions on the economy.
2. **Comparison Over Time:** By comparing the 1968 minimum wage to its equivalent value in 2014 dollars, the text highlights how wages have changed over time and how this might affect the economy.
3. **Contextual Implications:** The mention of ""a high-water mark"" suggests that the author is considering the implications of historical data on current economic discussions, making it relevant to the ECONOMIC_IMPACT aspect.

**1. YOUTH_AND_SECONDARY_WAGE_EARNERS**

Let's break down the reasoning for labeling the text as `YOUTH_AND_SECONDARY_WAGE_EARNERS`. 1. **Focus on Hours Worked:** The sentence highlights that ""About 70 percent of minimum wage employees... work fewer than 35 hours per week."" This is a key indicator often associated with part-time employment. 2. **Proportionately Less Earnings:** The phrase ""and thus earn proportionately less"" reinforces the idea that these workers are likely not relying on their minimum wage job as their primary source of income. 3. **Federal Labor Statistics:** The reference to ""federal labor statistics"" suggests a broader analysis of employment patterns, which often differentiate between full-time and part-time workers. These points collectively point towards a workforce segment that is more characteristic of `YOUTH_AND_SECONDARY_WAGE_EARNERS` - individuals who might be working part-time jobs for supplemental income or experience rather than as their primary means of support. Therefore, the correct label is `YOUTH_AND_SECONDARY_WAGE_EARNERS`.

**2. CAPITAL_VS_LABOR**

Let's break down why the label **CAPITAL_VS_LABOR** is appropriate for this text: 1. **""Exorbitant salaries earned by CEOs and other corporate titans""**: This phrase highlights a significant disparity in income between high-level executives (representing capital) and average workers. 2. **""Same people generally arguing against an increase in the minimum wage""**: This directly links those benefiting from high salaries (capital owners) to opposition towards policies that would improve the wages of workers (labor). 3. **Implicit Critique**: The text implicitly criticizes the power imbalance between capital and labor, suggesting that CEOs' resistance to a minimum wage hike stems from their desire to maintain this advantage. Therefore, the correct label is **CAPITAL_VS_LABOR**.

**3. SOCIAL JUSTICE/INJUSTICE**

Here's a step-by-step reasoning for why the label **SOCIAL JUSTICE/INJUSTICE** is correct: 1. **Focus on Fairness:** The text highlights a discrepancy between the actual minimum wage and a hypothetical minimum wage that keeps pace with labor productivity. This suggests a discussion about the fairness of worker compensation. 2. **Implied Inequality:** The phrase ""if the minimum wage had kept pace with labor productivity"" implies that workers are not receiving a fair share of the economic gains from increased productivity. This points towards the theme of inequality. 3. **Economic Justice:** The Economic Policy Institute is known for its research on issues related to economic justice and worker rights. Citing their data further strengthens the connection to social justice concerns. Therefore, the correct label is **SOCIAL JUSTICE/INJUSTICE**.

**4. UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE**

Let's analyze the text: ""After the president's speech, House Speaker John Boehner argued that raising the minimum wage would raise unemployment."" **Reasoning:** 1. **Focus on Unemployment**: The sentence explicitly mentions the potential impact of raising the minimum wage on ""unemployment."" 2. **Direct Relationship:** The argument presented by John Boehner directly links an increase in the minimum wage to a rise in unemployment.

2. **Specific Action Mentioned:** The phrase ""reduce employee benefits"" is a specific action that CFOs might take in response to the minimum wage change, indicating a discussion about business practices and their potential impact on employees.
3. **No Emphasis on Economic Impact or Social Justice:** Unlike some of the other aspects, this text does not primarily focus on the broader economic implications of raising the minimum wage (ECONOMIC_IMPACT) nor does it emphasize social justice concerns (SOCIAL JUSTICE/INJUSTICE). Instead, it zeroes in on how businesses might adapt their practices.
4. **Business Decision-Making:** The use of CFOs as the source for this information underscores the business-oriented focus of the text.

"I'm happy to help you with the problem! However, I notice that there are multiple text snippets provided, and I'll need to address each one separately. Here are the step-by-step solutions:

**Text 1:**

Input:
About 70 percent of minimum wage employees , however , work fewer than 35 hours per week and thus earn proportionately less , according to federal labor statistics .

Output:
Let's break down the reasoning for labeling the text as `YOUTH_AND_SECONDARY_WAGE_EARNERS`. 

1. **Focus on Hours Worked:** The sentence highlights that ""About 70 percent of minimum wage employees... work fewer than 35 hours per week."" This is a key indicator often associated with part-time employment.
2. **Proportionately Less Earnings:** The phrase ""and thus earn proportionately less"" reinforces the idea that these workers are likely not relying on their minimum wage job as their primary source of income.
3. **Federal Labor Statistics:** The reference to ""federal labor statistics"" suggests a broader analysis of employment patterns, which often differentiate between full-time and part-time workers.

**Text 2:**

Input:
That last argument is underscored by the exorbitant salaries earned by CEOs and other corporate titans , which are also the same people generally arguing against an increase in the minimum wage .

Output:
Let's break down why the label **CAPITAL_VS_LABOR** is appropriate for this text:

1. **""Exorbitant salaries earned by CEOs and other corporate titans""**: This phrase highlights a significant disparity in income between high-level executives (representing capital) and average workers.
2. **""Same people generally arguing against an increase in the minimum wage""**: This directly links those benefiting from high salaries (capital owners) to opposition towards policies that would improve the wages of workers (labor).
3. **Implicit Critique:** The text implicitly criticizes the power imbalance between capital and labor, suggesting that CEOs' resistance to a minimum wage hike stems from their desire to maintain this advantage.

**Text 3:**

Input:
According to the Economic Policy Institute , the minimum wage in the United States would have been $ 18.28 in 2013 if the minimum wage had kept pace with labor productivity .

Output:
Here's a step-by-step reasoning for why the label **SOCIAL JUSTICE/INJUSTICE** is correct:

1. **Focus on Fairness:** The text highlights a discrepancy between the actual minimum wage and a hypothetical minimum wage that keeps pace with labor productivity. This suggests a discussion about the fairness of worker compensation.
2. **Implied Inequality:** The phrase ""if the minimum wage had kept pace with labor productivity"" implies that workers are not receiving a fair share of the economic gains from increased productivity.
3. **Economic Justice:** The Economic Policy Institute is known for its research on issues related to economic justice and worker rights.

**Text 4:**

Input:
After the president ' s speech , House Speaker John Boehner argued that raising the minimum wage would raise unemployment .

Output:
Let's analyze the text:

1. **Focus on Unemployment**: The sentence explicitly mentions the potential impact of raising the minimum wage on ""unemployment.""
2. **Direct Relationship:** The argument presented by John Boehner directly links an increase in the minimum wage to a rise in unemployment.

**Text 5:**

Input:
Myth : Increasing the minimum wage is bad for the economy .

Output:
Let's break down the reasoning for labeling the text as ECONOMIC_IMPACT:

1. **Focus on Economy:** The statement directly addresses the impact of increasing the minimum wage ""on the economy"".
2. **Codebook Alignment:** This aligns with the definition of the `ECONOMIC_IMPACT` aspect in the codebook, which emphasizes the effects of minimum wage on the economy as a whole.
3. **General Effect:** The phrase ""bad for the economy"" suggests a discussion about broader economic consequences, rather than specific aspects like unemployment or business challenges.

1. **Focus on Entry-Level Employment:** The sentence directly mentions reducing ""entry-level employment.""
2. **Impact on Workforce:** Reducing entry-level jobs has implications for workforce composition and possibly labor market dynamics.
3. **Potential Effect of Minimum Wage Increase:** While not explicitly stated, the context suggests that raising the minimum wage could impact entry-level positions, leading to a potential reduction in their availability.

1. **Focus on Economic Effect:** The sentence explicitly mentions the ""net economic effect"" of minimum wage laws.
2. **Specific Impact:** It highlights a specific consequence of minimum wage laws, which is to make certain workers (less skilled, less experienced) more expensive and thereby pricing them out of jobs.
3. **Codebook Alignment:** This aligns with the definition of the `LABOR_MARKET_EFFECT` aspect in the codebook, which emphasizes the impact of minimum wage on labor market outcomes.

However, upon closer inspection, the text also touches on a specific subgroup that is often associated with labor market effects related to minimum wage policies: less skilled workers.

1. **Focus on Unions:** The statement directly mentions ""the minimum wage law"" having an impact on unions.
2. **Labor Relations Context:** The phrase suggests a discussion within the realm of labor relations and collective bargaining, as it implies that the policy (minimum wage) affects union interests or effectiveness.

"Based on the provided text, here's the reasoning for labeling it as YOUTH_AND_SECONDARY_WAGE_EARNERS:

1. **Focus on Typical Worker**: The sentence starts with ""Not true: The typical minimum wage worker..."", which implies that the following description is meant to correct a common misconception about who typically works at the minimum wage.
2. **Contrast with Common Perception**: By stating that ""The typical minimum wage worker is not a high school student earning weekend pocket money"", it suggests that people often mistakenly believe that many or most minimum wage workers are students working part-time for extra cash. This implies that there might be another group of individuals who work at the minimum wage and this group does not fit the common perception.
3. **Implicit Mention of Other Groups**: The text doesn't explicitly mention other groups, but by stating what is ""not true"", it implicitly suggests that the typical minimum wage worker belongs to a different category.

However, since there's no explicit information about the characteristics or demographics of this group (e.g., age, job type, income level), we can only make educated guesses. Based on the provided text alone, the label YOUTH_AND_SECONDARY_WAGE_EARNERS seems plausible because it is often associated with part-time workers who might be earning minimum wage for supplemental income rather than as their primary source of employment.

2. **Reference to Price Controls:** The phrase ""Like all government price controls"" implies a broader discussion about the impact of government intervention in markets, which is often discussed within economic theory.
3. **Distinction from Empirical or Social Justice Discussion:** Unlike labels like ECONOMIC_IMPACT or SOCIAL JUSTICE/INJUSTICE, this text does not focus on specific consequences for workers (as in UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE) or broader social implications (like CAPITAL_VS_LABOR).

That being said, let's break down a similar text and apply the same principles:

Let's say the output is ""Employees' Fair Treatment Leads to Customer Appreciation."" Here's how we could analyze it:

1. **Focus on Employee Treatment:** The sentence highlights that the business ""treats their employees fairly.""
2. **Positive Outcomes from this Treatment:** It mentions gaining new customers and receiving gratitude from them.
3. **Implication of a Positive Business Environment:** This suggests that treating employees well leads to positive outcomes for the business, such as customer appreciation.

Based on these points, the correct label could be **EMPLOYEE_TREATMENT**, which aligns with the aspect focusing on how businesses treat their employees and its effects.

"Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Focus on Productivity**: The text highlights ""greater productivity"" as an indicator of economic growth or success.
2. **Share of Wealth and Workers**: The sentence emphasizes that despite increased productivity, workers have seen less benefit from this productivity in terms of wealth distribution.

**Reasoning:** This points towards a discussion about how the benefits of increased productivity are being distributed between capital (companies) and labor (workers).
