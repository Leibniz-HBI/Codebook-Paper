1. **Focus on Economic Activity:** The sentence highlights how a minimum wage can stimulate ""consumption"" and put more money into the economy. This focuses on economic activity and growth.
2. **Increased Spending:** The idea that low-paid workers will spend more due to higher wages suggests an increase in demand, which is a key driver of economic growth.
3. **Putting Money into the Economy:** The phrase ""put more money into the economy"" explicitly mentions the flow of resources into the broader economic system, further emphasizing the aspect of economic growth.
4. **Alignment with Codebook Definition:** This aligns with the definition of the `ECONOMIC_GROWTH` aspect in the codebook, which includes discussions about how minimum wage affects the overall economy and its activities.

"Here's a step-by-step reasoning for why the label **LABOR_MARKET_EFFECTS** is correct:

1.  **Focus on Labor Market:** The quote by Seth Zimmerman focuses on how minimum wage laws affect ""labor market rigidities"". This indicates an interest in understanding the consequences of minimum wage policies on labor dynamics.
2.  **""Lead to labor market rigidities"":** The specific mention of ""rigidities"" points towards changes or challenges within the labor market, suggesting that the text explores the impact of minimum wage laws on employment and job mobility.
3.  **Impact on Career Advancement:** Zimmerman's statement also discusses how these rigidities make it more difficult for people to advance in their careers (""move up the economic ladder""), which underscores a concern with the broader implications for workers' career prospects.

**Snippet 1:**
About 70 percent of minimum wage employees , however , work fewer than 35 hours per week and thus earn proportionately less , according to federal labor statistics .

**Label:** `YOUTH_AND_SECONDARY_WAGE_EARNERS`

Reasoning:
1. **Focus on Hours Worked:** The sentence highlights that ""About 70 percent of minimum wage employees... work fewer than 35 hours per week."" This is a key indicator often associated with part-time employment.
2. **Proportionately Less Earnings:** The phrase ""and thus earn proportionately less"" reinforces the idea that these workers are likely not relying on their minimum wage job as their primary source of income.
3. **Federal Labor Statistics:** The reference to ""federal labor statistics"" suggests a broader analysis of employment patterns, which often differentiate between full-time and part-time workers.

**Snippet 2:**
That last argument is underscored by the exorbitant salaries earned by CEOs and other corporate titans , which are also the same people generally arguing against an increase in the minimum wage .

**Label:** `CAPITAL_VS_LABOR`

Reasoning:
1. **""Exorbitant salaries earned by CEOs and other corporate titans""**: This phrase highlights a significant disparity in income between high-level executives (representing capital) and average workers.
2. **""Same people generally arguing against an increase in the minimum wage""**: This directly links those benefiting from high salaries (capital owners) to opposition towards policies that would improve the wages of workers (labor).
3. **Implicit Critique:** The text implicitly criticizes the power imbalance between capital and labor, suggesting that CEOs' resistance to a minimum wage hike stems from their desire to maintain this advantage.

**Snippet 3:**
According to the Economic Policy Institute , the minimum wage in the United States would have been $ 18.28 in 2013 if the minimum wage had kept pace with labor productivity .

**Label:** `SOCIAL JUSTICE/INJUSTICE`

Reasoning:
1. **Focus on Fairness:** The text highlights a discrepancy between the actual minimum wage and a hypothetical minimum wage that keeps pace with labor productivity.
2. **Implied Inequality:** The phrase ""if the minimum wage had kept pace with labor productivity"" implies that workers are not receiving a fair share of the economic gains from increased productivity.
3. **Economic Justice:** The Economic Policy Institute is known for its research on issues related to economic justice and worker rights.

**Snippet 4:**
After the president ' s speech , House Speaker John Boehner argued that raising the minimum wage would raise unemployment .

Reasoning:

1. **Focus on Hours Worked:** The sentence highlights that ""About 70 percent of minimum wage employees... work fewer than 35 hours per week."" This is a key indicator often associated with part-time employment.
2. **Proportionately Less Earnings:** The phrase ""and thus earn proportionately less"" reinforces the idea that these workers are likely not relying on their minimum wage job as their primary source of income.
3. **Federal Labor Statistics:** The reference to ""federal labor statistics"" suggests a broader analysis of employment patterns, which often differentiate between full-time and part-time workers.

These points collectively point towards a workforce segment that is more characteristic of `YOUTH_AND_SECONDARY_WAGE_EARNERS` - individuals who might be working part-time jobs for supplemental income or experience rather than as their primary means of support.

**Text 1:**

About 70 percent of minimum wage employees , however , work fewer than 35 hours per week and thus earn proportionately less , according to federal labor statistics .

**Output:** YOUTH_AND_SECONDARY_WAGE_EARNERS

Reasoning:
1. Focus on Hours Worked: The sentence highlights that ""About 70 percent of minimum wage employees... work fewer than 35 hours per week."" This is a key indicator often associated with part-time employment.
2. Proportionately Less Earnings: The phrase ""and thus earn proportionately less"" reinforces the idea that these workers are likely not relying on their minimum wage job as their primary source of income.
3. Federal Labor Statistics: The reference to ""federal labor statistics"" suggests a broader analysis of employment patterns, which often differentiate between full-time and part-time workers.

These points collectively point towards a workforce segment that is more characteristic of `YOUTH_AND_SECONDARY_WAGE_EARNERS` - individuals who might be working part-time jobs for supplemental income or experience rather than as their primary means of support.

**Text 2:**

That last argument is underscored by the exorbitant salaries earned by CEOs and other corporate titans , which are also the same people generally arguing against an increase in the minimum wage .

**Output:** CAPITAL_VS_LABOR

Reasoning:
1. ""Exorbitant salaries earned by CEOs and other corporate titans"": This phrase highlights a significant disparity in income between high-level executives (representing capital) and average workers.
2. ""Same people generally arguing against an increase in the minimum wage"": This directly links those benefiting from high salaries (capital owners) to opposition towards policies that would improve the wages of workers (labor).
3. Implicit Critique: The text implicitly criticizes the power imbalance between capital and labor, suggesting that CEOs' resistance to a minimum wage hike stems from their desire to maintain this advantage.

Therefore, the correct label is CAPITAL_VS_LABOR.

**Text 3:**

According to the Economic Policy Institute , the minimum wage in the United States would have been $ 18.28 in 2013 if the minimum wage had kept pace with labor productivity .

**Output:** SOCIAL JUSTICE/INJUSTICE

Reasoning:
1. Focus on Fairness: The text highlights a discrepancy between the actual minimum wage and a hypothetical minimum wage that keeps pace with labor productivity. This suggests a discussion about the fairness of worker compensation.
2. Implied Inequality: The phrase ""if the minimum wage had kept pace with labor productivity"" implies that workers are not receiving a fair share of the economic gains from increased productivity. This points towards the theme of inequality.
3. Economic Justice: The Economic Policy Institute is known for its research on issues related to economic justice and worker rights. Citing their data further strengthens the connection to social justice concerns.

Therefore, the correct label is SOCIAL JUSTICE/INJUSTICE.

**Text 4:**

After the president ' s speech , House Speaker John Boehner argued that raising the minimum wage would raise unemployment .

**Output:** UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE

Reasoning:
1. Focus on Unemployment: The sentence explicitly mentions the potential impact of raising the minimum wage on ""unemployment.""
2. Direct Relationship: The argument presented by John Boehner directly links an increase in the minimum wage to a rise in unemployment. This establishes a clear cause-and-effect relationship within the context of the `UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE` aspect.

Therefore, the correct label is UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE.

**Text 5:**

"Here are the step-by-step reasons why each text snippet should be labeled as follows:

1. **Input:** About 70 percent of minimum wage employees, however, work fewer than 35 hours per week and thus earn proportionately less, according to federal labor statistics.
**Output:** Label: YOUTH_AND_SECONDARY_WAGE_EARNERS

   Reasoning:
   - Focus on Hours Worked: The sentence highlights that ""About 70 percent of minimum wage employees... work fewer than 35 hours per week."" This is a key indicator often associated with part-time employment.
   - Proportionately Less Earnings: The phrase ""and thus earn proportionately less"" reinforces the idea that these workers are likely not relying on their minimum wage job as their primary source of income.
   - Federal Labor Statistics: The reference to ""federal labor statistics"" suggests a broader analysis of employment patterns, which often differentiate between full-time and part-time workers.

2. **Input:** That last argument is underscored by the exorbitant salaries earned by CEOs and other corporate titans, which are also the same people generally arguing against an increase in the minimum wage.
**Output:** Label: CAPITAL_VS_LABOR

   Reasoning:
   - ""Exorbitant salaries earned by CEOs and other corporate titans"": This phrase highlights a significant disparity in income between high-level executives (representing capital) and average workers.
   - ""Same people generally arguing against an increase in the minimum wage"": This directly links those benefiting from high salaries (capital owners) to opposition towards policies that would improve the wages of workers (labor).
   - Implicit Critique: The text implicitly criticizes the power imbalance between capital and labor, suggesting that CEOs' resistance to a minimum wage hike stems from their desire to maintain this advantage.

3. **Input:** According to the Economic Policy Institute, the minimum wage in the United States would have been $18.28 in 2013 if the minimum wage had kept pace with labor productivity.
**Output:** Label: SOCIAL JUSTICE/INJUSTICE

   Reasoning:
   - Focus on Fairness: The text highlights a discrepancy between the actual minimum wage and a hypothetical minimum wage that keeps pace with labor productivity, suggesting a discussion about fairness in worker compensation.
   - Implied Inequality: The phrase ""if the minimum wage had kept pace with labor productivity"" implies that workers are not receiving a fair share of the economic gains from increased productivity.
   - Economic Justice: The Economic Policy Institute is known for its research on issues related to economic justice and worker rights.

4. **Input:** After the president's speech, House Speaker John Boehner argued that raising the minimum wage would raise unemployment.
**Output:** Label: UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE

   Reasoning:
   - Focus on Unemployment: The sentence explicitly mentions the potential impact of raising the minimum wage on ""unemployment.""
   - Direct Relationship: The argument presented by John Boehner directly links an increase in the minimum wage to a rise in unemployment.

5. **Input:** Myth: Increasing the minimum wage is bad for the economy.
**Output:** Label: ECONOMIC_IMPACT

   Reasoning:
   - Focus on Economy: The statement directly addresses the impact of increasing the minimum wage ""on the economy"".
   - Codebook Alignment: This aligns with the definition of the `ECONOMIC_IMPACT` aspect in the codebook, which emphasizes the effects of minimum wage on the economy as a whole.

The text describes a situation where treating employees fairly leads to positive outcomes for the business, such as gaining new customers and maintaining good relationships. This is often seen as a key aspect of employer branding and corporate social responsibility.

Therefore, the correct label is likely **POSITIVE_EMPLOYER_IMAGE**.",llama3.1:8b-instruct-fp16,2024-09-12T15:40:55.155454977Z,stop,5410170605,60285397,1026,247767000,225,5056618000,“ We ’ve gained many new customers who have written us notes telling us how grateful they are that we treat our employees fairly .,['SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE'],0,[]
"Let's break down the reasoning for labeling the text as **SOCIAL JUSTICE/INJUSTICE**:

1. **Focus on Wealth Distribution:** The sentence highlights a trend where the share of wealth created from productivity is not benefiting workers, but rather being retained by companies.
2. **Implied Injustice:** The use of ""less"" to describe the portion going towards workers implies a sense of unfairness or inequality in how economic gains are distributed.
3. **Reference to EPI Article:** The mention of an Economic Policy Institute (EPI) article further reinforces the connection to social justice concerns, as EPI is known for its research on worker rights and income inequality.

Therefore, the correct label is **SOCIAL JUSTICE/INJUSTICE**.",llama3.1:8b-instruct-fp16,2024-09-12T15:40:59.040705249Z,stop,3822835971,75731936,1026,249866000,154,3451279000,"Although companies are experiencing greater productivity , since the ‘ 70s , less of the share of wealth created from that productivity has been going towards workers ( Check out this EPI article for more details ) .",['CAPITAL_VS_LABOR'],1,['SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE']
"Let's break down the reasoning for labeling the text as **UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE**:

1. **Focus on Employment**: The sentence highlights the impact of increasing the minimum wage on ""teen employment"".
2. **Specific Percentage Changes**: It mentions specific percentage changes in teen employment (3-5%) that are correlated with a 10% increase in the minimum wage.
3. **Statistical Analysis**: The study's findings, as reported in the text, suggest an empirical relationship between the minimum wage and employment rates among teens.

"Here's the step-by-step reasoning for why the label `EFFICIENCY` is correct:

1. **Focus on Efficiency:** The text discusses how raising wages ""spurs"" (encourages or improves) businesses to become ""more efficient"".
2. **Impact on Business Practices:** This implies that the discussion is centered around the operational efficiency of businesses, rather than other aspects like unemployment or economic impact.
3. **Codebook Alignment:** This aligns with the definition of `EFFICIENCY` in the codebook, which emphasizes discussions about how businesses respond to increased wages.

Therefore, the correct label is `EFFICIENCY`.",llama3.1:8b-instruct-fp16,2024-09-12T15:41:05.604707529Z,stop,3300799702,73718974,1026,248433000,129,2888986000,"They say that instead of forcing businesses to cut staff , raising wages simply spurs them to become more efficient .","['COMPETITION/BUSINESS_CHALLENGES', 'UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE']",0,[]
"Let's break down the reasoning for labeling the text as **PRICE_AND_INFLATION**:

1. **Focus on Prices:** The sentence explicitly mentions the potential effect of increasing wages on ""prices"" of retailers' services and products.
2. **Direct Relationship:** The statement suggests a direct link between an increase in labor costs (wage) and a subsequent response from businesses (raising prices), which indicates a discussion about price dynamics within the context of inflation.
3. **Inflation Implication:** Raising prices due to increased wages can contribute to higher inflation, making this aspect relevant.

Therefore, the correct label is **PRICE_AND_INFLATION**.",llama3.1:8b-instruct-fp16,2024-09-12T15:41:09.058525032Z,stop,3348906710,76537889,1026,251117000,133,2976931000,Retailers may find that they will raise prices on their services and products with a wage increase .,['PRICES'],0,[]
"Based on the text, I will analyze why the label **LABOR_VERSUS_GOVERNMENT** is appropriate:

1.  **""Mutual Agreement""**: The phrase ""let the terms and conditions of wages be set by mutual agreement"" suggests a desire for employers and employees to negotiate wages independently, without external interference.
2.  **Government Control**: The text explicitly mentions ""government control and fiat,"" indicating that it is specifically discussing government involvement in wage setting.
3.  **Implicit Critique**: By advocating for mutual agreement over government intervention, the text implies that current or proposed policies (e.g., minimum wage laws) are seen as overly restrictive or burdensome on employers.

Therefore, the correct label is **LABOR_VERSUS_GOVERNMENT**",llama3.1:8b-instruct-fp16,2024-09-12T15:41:13.024506613Z,stop,3903864067,32365049,1026,244000000,156,3498112000,"Let the terms and conditions of wages be set by mutual agreement , not by government control and fiat .",['GOVERNMENT'],1,['GOVERNMENT']
