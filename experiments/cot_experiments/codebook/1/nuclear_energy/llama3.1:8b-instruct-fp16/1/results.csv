**Codebook Reference:** None directly mentioned, but let's consider various aspects related to nuclear energy.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Focus on Waste:** The text mentions spent fuel rods and specifically highlights that a significant portion (95%) is non-fissionable U-238, which implies a discussion about the composition of nuclear waste.
2. **Comparison with Other Substances:** The comparison of U-238 in granite tabletops, stone buildings, and coal burned for electricity suggests an exploration of how nuclear materials are similar to or different from other common substances.
3. **Codebook Alignment:** While there isn't a direct match, aspects related to waste management or the composition and properties of nuclear materials could be considered under broader categories like [WASTE] or more specific ones if they were explicitly mentioned in the codebook.

Given these points, without an explicit category that matches perfectly, and considering the focus on the composition of spent fuel rods and their similarity to other substances found in everyday objects, a label that might fit is **[NUCLEAR_MATERIALS]**. However, this is not a direct match according to the provided codebook categories, indicating that more specific or additional context would be needed for precise labeling.

"Based on the codebook guidelines and analysis provided, let's break down the text to determine the most appropriate label:

1. **Focus:** The sentence highlights a general trend or fact about energy needs.
2. **Keywords:** The phrase ""the world’s energy needs"" is broad and does not specifically mention nuclear power.
3. **Codebook Alignment:** This statement aligns with the [ENERGY DEMAND] category, which includes mentions of the demand for energy in general.

However, since this category is too broad and doesn't specifically relate to nuclear power or its related aspects, we can consider the text in relation to other categories:

1. **Connection to Nuclear Power:** While the statement about growing energy needs does not directly mention nuclear power, it implies that there will be an increasing need for all forms of energy.
2. **Public Debate and Perception:** The topic is general enough to potentially influence public debate or perception about various energy sources, including nuclear power.

Given these considerations:

* [ENERGY DEMAND] could be too broad without a clear connection to nuclear power.
* **[PUBLIC_DEBATE]** might be too specific if the primary focus is not on how this growing demand influences perceptions or debates about nuclear power specifically.

However, upon closer inspection of the codebook and guidelines provided, there isn't an explicit category that perfectly matches the information given in the text.
