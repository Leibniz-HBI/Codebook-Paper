## Step 1: Identify Key Phrases
For the first text snippet ""3) Marijuana is terrible for your mental health: Marijuana may even be WORSE than cigarettes."", let's break it down:
- The key phrase here is the negative impact of marijuana on mental health and its comparison to another harmful substance, cigarettes.

## Step 2: Match to Codebook Categories
The codebook likely has categories that address health impacts or comparative effects. Since the text focuses on the negative health implications of marijuana and compares it unfavorably with cigarettes, a category related to the health risks or adverse effects would be appropriate.

1. **Identify Key Phrases:** The sentence mentions ""the theory that cannabis leads to other drugs"" and states it was ""discarded long ago"".
2. **Match to Codebook Categories:** The codebook defines LEGITIMIZATION as ""MJ becomes accepted/normalized in society.""
3. **Direct Relevance:** The text implies a shift in societal attitudes towards marijuana, moving away from the idea that it leads to harder drugs.

2. **Description of Addiction Process:** The passage details the progression of addiction, from initial usage to increased consumption and eventual difficulties.
3. **Focus on Experience:** The language emphasizes personal experience (""Anybody who's experienced it...""), highlighting the lived reality of marijuana addiction.

**Input 4:**

"" Students suck on lollipops between classes , go into class stoned , learn nothing , and teachers are increasingly helpless .

Output:
The correct label for this text is **CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY**. Here's why:

1. **Focus on Students:** The text explicitly mentions ""Students"" as the subject, highlighting a demographic particularly relevant to child and teen safety concerns.
2. **Substance Use:** The phrase ""go into class stoned"" strongly implies marijuana use among students.
3. **Negative Consequences:** The text outlines negative outcomes associated with this substance use: impaired cognitive function (""learn nothing"") and disruption to the learning environment (""teachers are increasingly helpless"").

In her testimony before the committee, Dr. Pacula stated that prohibition raises the cost of production by at least 400 percent and that legalizing marijuana would cause the price of marijuana to fall considerably — much more than the 50 percent price reduction incorporated into the state’s revenue model.

To determine the correct label, we need to analyze the text and match it with the categories in the codebook. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Identify Key Phrases:** The text mentions ""prohibition,"" ""legalizing marijuana,"" and ""price reduction."" These phrases are likely related to the economic aspects of marijuana policy.
2. **Match to Codebook Categories:** The codebook defines several categories, but none directly mention ""prohibition"" or ""price reduction."" However, we can look for categories that relate to the economics of marijuana policy.
3. **Direct Relevance:** The text discusses how prohibition affects the cost of production and how legalization would impact prices. This is a key aspect of the economic implications of marijuana policy.

3. **Contrast with Other Categories:** The argument made (legalization won't increase use) counters concerns often associated with CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY, like increased access and potential for minors' use. This distinction supports the categorization as ADULT_USE.

**Input:**
Other believe it helps in the treatment of depression .

**Output:** Let's break down why the label **MEDICAL_MARIJUANA** is correct for the text ""Others believe it helps in the treatment of depression."" 

1. **Identify Key Phrases:** The sentence focuses on the potential benefits of marijuana (""it helps"") for a specific medical condition (""treatment of depression"").
2. **Match to Codebook Categories:** The codebook defines **MEDICAL_MARIJUANA** as ""MJ as a treatment for various diseases"".
3. **Direct Relevance:** Depression is a disease, and the sentence explicitly states a belief that marijuana can help treat it. Therefore, the correct label is **MEDICAL_MARIJUANA**.

**Input:**
Even smoking weed at home will allow the drug to make its way to others , especially if it is a multi-level apartment complex .

**Output:** Let's break down why the label **PERSONAL_FREEDOM** is correctly assigned to the text:

1. **Focus on Impact Beyond the Individual:** The sentence explicitly states ""Even smoking weed at home will allow the drug to make its way to others"". This highlights a concern about the potential consequences of marijuana use extending beyond the individual smoker.
2. **Implication of Shared Space:** The mention of a ""multi-level apartment complex"" emphasizes the shared nature of living spaces and introduces the idea that personal choices (like smoking weed) can impact others in close proximity.
3. **Contrasting Perspectives on Freedom:** The text implicitly contrasts the argument for personal freedom to smoke marijuana with the potential infringement on the freedom of others to live in a drug-free environment.

**Input:**
Even the gateway effect — the theory that cannabis leads to other drugs — was discarded long ago .

**Output:** 1. **Identify keywords:** The text mentions the ""gateway effect"" and ""cannabis leads to other drugs"".
2. **Match keywords with codebook categories:** These keywords directly correspond to the definition of the **GATEWAY_DRUG** aspect in the codebook, which states: ""Marijuana use leads to the use of harder drugs.""
3. **Sentence structure:** The sentence structure itself refutes the gateway effect theory (""was discarded long ago"").

**Output:** Let's break down the text and see why the label ""ADDICTION"" is appropriate:

1. **Direct Statement of Addiction:** The text starts with ""Anybody who's experienced it, actually been addicted to it..."". This directly states that the speaker is referring to marijuana addiction.
2. **Description of Addiction Process:** The passage then describes the progression of addiction: how some people can function seemingly normally for years despite being addicted, but eventually experience diminishing returns (""the high starts wearing off"") leading them to increase their consumption and ultimately face difficulties.
3. **Focus on Experience:** The language emphasizes personal experience (""Anybody who's experienced it...""), highlighting the lived reality of marijuana addiction.

**Input:**

2. **Substance Use:** The phrase ""go into class stoned"" strongly implies marijuana use among students.
3. **Negative Consequences:** The text outlines negative outcomes associated with this substance use: * ""learn nothing"" - suggesting impaired cognitive function. * ""teachers are increasingly helpless"" - indicating a broader disruption to the learning environment.
