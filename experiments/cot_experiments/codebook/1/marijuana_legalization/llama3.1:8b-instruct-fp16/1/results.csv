1. **Criminalization Mentioned:** The passage mentions ""After three decades, criminalization has not affected general usage."" This indicates that marijuana use is currently subject to legal restrictions or prohibitions.
2. **Focus on Legal Status:** Despite its failure to reduce usage (""has not affected general usage""), criminalization remains a significant aspect of the discussion about marijuana.

1. **Identify Key Phrases:** The sentence focuses on the regulation of pharmaceuticals, specifically in relation to a proposition (a law or proposal) regarding marijuana use.
2. **Match to Codebook Categories:** The codebook defines **PHARMACEUTICAL_REGULATION** as ""Regulation of prescription and over-the-counter drugs"". While marijuana is not typically classified as a traditional pharmaceutical, the text's focus on regulation and the use of medical language suggests it falls under this category.
3. **Direct Relevance:** The text explicitly mentions a law (California Proposition 215) being misrepresented regarding its potential benefits and negative impacts. This suggests concerns about how such substances are regulated, making **PHARMACEUTICAL_REGULATION** an appropriate label.

2. **Match to Codebook Categories:** The codebook defines various categories related to marijuana, including MEDICAL_MARIJUANA, PERSONAL_FREEDOM, GATEWAY_DRUG, ADDICTION, and CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY.
3. **Analysis:** However, the sentence does not explicitly mention any of these categories. Instead, it presents a balanced view, stating that there are ""lots of benefits"" to smoking pot but also acknowledges some ""non-beneficial issues"".
4. **Potential Label:** Based on this analysis, the label ILLEGAL_TRADE is not directly supported by the text. The sentence does not mention any aspects related to illegal trade, such as the potential threat posed by cartels or the movement of marijuana across borders.
5. **Conclusion:** Therefore, the correct label for this input cannot be determined with certainty based on the provided analysis.

Input:
Others believe it helps in the treatment of depression .

Output:
Let's break down why the label **MEDICAL_MARIJUANA** is correct for the text ""Others believe it helps in the treatment of depression."" 

1. **Identify Key Phrases:** The sentence focuses on the potential benefits of marijuana (""it helps"") for a specific medical condition (""treatment of depression""). 
2. **Match to Codebook Categories:** The codebook defines **MEDICAL_MARIJUANA** as ""MJ as a treatment for various diseases"".
3. **Direct Relevance:** Depression is a disease, and the sentence explicitly states a belief that marijuana can help treat it. Therefore, the correct label is **MEDICAL_MARIJUANA**.

Input:
Even smoking weed at home will allow the drug to make its way to others , especially if it is a multi-level apartment complex .

Output:
Let's break down why the label **PERSONAL_FREEDOM** is correctly assigned to the text:

1. **Focus on Impact Beyond the Individual:** The sentence explicitly states ""Even smoking weed at home will allow the drug to make its way to others"". This highlights a concern about the potential consequences of marijuana use extending beyond the individual smoker.
2. **Implication of Shared Space:** The mention of a ""multi-level apartment complex"" emphasizes the shared nature of living spaces and introduces the idea that personal choices (like smoking weed) can impact others in close proximity.
3. **Contrasting Perspectives on Freedom:** The text implicitly contrasts the argument for personal freedom to smoke marijuana with the potential infringement on the freedom of others to live in a drug-free environment. Therefore, the correct label is **PERSONAL_FREEDOM**.

Input:

Output:
1. **Identify keywords:** The text mentions the ""gateway effect"" and ""cannabis leads to other drugs"".
2. **Match keywords with codebook categories:** These keywords directly correspond to the definition of the **GATEWAY DRUG** aspect in the codebook, which states: ""Marijuana use leads to the use of harder drugs.""

Output:
Let's break down the text and see why the label ""ADDICTION"" is appropriate:

1. **Direct Statement of Addiction:** The text starts with ""Anybody who's experienced it, actually been addicted to it..."". This directly states that the speaker is referring to marijuana addiction.
2. **Description of Addiction Process:** The passage then describes the progression of addiction: how some people can function seemingly normally for years despite being addicted, but eventually experience diminishing returns (""the high starts wearing off"") leading them to increase their consumption and ultimately face difficulties.
3. **Focus on Experience:** The language emphasizes personal experience (""Anybody who's experienced it...""), highlighting the lived reality of marijuana addiction. Therefore, the correct label is ADDICTION.

Input:
