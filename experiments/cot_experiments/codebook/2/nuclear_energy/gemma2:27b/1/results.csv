2. **Implied Argument:** The speaker questions whether a system requiring such widespread infrastructure can be considered decentralized. This implies a debate about the concentration of power and resources.
3. **Codebook Alignment:**  The codebook definition for [CENTRALIZATION] includes discussions about:
    * ""Concentration vs. dispersion of nuclear power plants""
    * ""Arguments for and against centralized vs. decentralized energy production""

Therefore, based on the comparison, implied argument, and alignment with the codebook, **[CENTRALIZATION]** is the correct label.
