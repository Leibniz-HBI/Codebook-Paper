2. **""Less Politically Palatable"":** This phrase directly highlights the political dimension. It suggests that a tax credit faces stronger opposition or reluctance due to its direct budgetary impact.

It argues that the wage should be intentionally set at a level insufficient for survival, implying it's morally acceptable to force people into seeking better opportunities.
2. **Motivation vs Exploitation:** While mentioning motivation, the statement fundamentally relies on the exploitation of individuals' need for basic necessities to drive them towards ""something better."" This raises ethical questions about using hardship as a motivator. 

3. **Beyond Economic Impact:** The text goes beyond discussing economic effects (prices, employment) and delves into the ethical implications of how a minimum wage should function within society.

    * **Reduced Bargaining Power:** A higher minimum wage might lessen the need for union negotiations as employers are already obligated to pay a certain baseline wage.
