1. **Progression of Drug Use:** The sentence describes a pattern of escalating drug use, starting with marijuana and progressing to ""harder stuff"" like heroin, LSD, and cocaine. 2. **Implication of Causation:** The phrasing ""then turn to the harder stuff"" suggests that initial marijuana use leads users down a path towards more dangerous drugs. This aligns with the core concept of the gateway drug theory.

While other labels like **HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTS** or **DRUG_POLICY** might be tangentially related, the central theme of the sentence is the supposed role of marijuana as a precursor to harder drug use, making **GATEWAY_DRUG** the most accurate label.
