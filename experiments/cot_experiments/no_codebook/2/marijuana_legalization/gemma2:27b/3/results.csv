2. **Implied Causation:**  The phrasing ""thus, users then turn..."" suggests that marijuana use is a precursor or catalyst for turning towards more dangerous drugs.

This aligns with the concept of the **GATEWAY_DRUG** theory, which posits that using less harmful substances like marijuana can lead individuals down a path toward harder drug use.
