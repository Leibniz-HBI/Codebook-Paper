1. **Focus on Community Impact:** The sentence directly addresses the perceived impact of the ""cannabis industry"" on a specific ""community.""

1. **Direct Comparison:** The sentence explicitly compares marijuana prohibition to alcohol prohibition, framing marijuana within the context of legal substances and historical policy shifts.

2. **Implied Argument:**  While not stating it outright, the quote implies an argument in favor of legalizing marijuana. By comparing it to a failed policy (alcohol prohibition), the speaker suggests that prohibiting marijuana is similarly illogical and ultimately ineffective.

* **Consistency in Label:** While ""LEGAL_DRUGS"" might encompass the arguments presented in the last example, it's worth considering if **LEGALIZATION** (or even **DRUG POLICY**) would be more precise labels. The focus is on the act of legalization itself and its consequences rather than solely comparing marijuana to legal substances.
