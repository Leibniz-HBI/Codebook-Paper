1. **Purchasing Power:** The sentence directly mentions ""purchasing power"" which is a key economic indicator tied to inflation.  Losing purchasing power means that the same amount of money buys less goods and services over time due to rising prices. 
2. **Inflationary Impact:** The phrase ""lost 8.1% of its purchasing power to inflation"" explicitly states the effect of inflation on the value of the minimum wage. This highlights the eroding effect of price increases on real wages.
3. **Codebook Alignment:** The [PRICES] category in your codebook likely includes aspects related to inflation and how it affects the cost of living, aligning perfectly with the text's focus on purchasing power loss due to inflation.

Therefore, the correct label is **[PRICES]**.

"Let's analyze why the label **[POLICY]** is a good fit for this text.

1. **Focus on Policy Mechanics:** The sentence compares two policy approaches: ""a tax credit"" and ""raising the minimum wage."" It discusses their respective political implications (""less politically palatable"") and budgetary effects (""takes money directly out of federal coffers"").

2. **Policy Implementation and Cost:** The text highlights key considerations in implementing these policies, such as their visibility in government budgets.

3. **Alignment with Codebook Definition:** The codebook likely defines ""[POLICY]"" as encompassing discussions about specific policy proposals, their design, implementation, and political feasibility. This sentence clearly fits within that scope.

"Let's analyze why **[BUSINESSES]** is the most appropriate label for this text:

1. **Direct Impact:** The phrase ""increasing the minimum wage forces businesses to get thinner"" explicitly states that raising the minimum wage directly impacts businesses. 

2. **""Getting Thinner"":** This metaphor implies businesses cutting costs, possibly through layoffs or reduced operations – actions typically undertaken by companies facing financial pressure, often caused by increased labor expenses (like a higher minimum wage).

3. **Codebook Alignment:** The [BUSINESSES] category in the codebook likely includes discussions about how minimum wage changes affect business practices, profitability, and potential responses like hiring freezes or downsizing.

"Here's why the label **[INCOME]** is suitable for this text:

1. **Focus on Wages:** The sentence directly addresses the concept of a ""minimum wage"" which guarantees a ""minimum"" payment for workers. This centers the discussion around income levels. 

2. **Impact on Low-Skilled Workers:**  The text specifically mentions ""low-skilled workers"" and emphasizes that they will be ""paid a guaranteed minimum."" This highlights the impact of minimum wage policy on the income of a particular demographic.

3. **Encouragement to Work:** The sentence suggests that a guaranteed minimum wage encourages individuals to seek employment and become financially self-sufficient. This further reinforces the link between minimum wage and individual income.

Therefore, the label **[INCOME]** accurately reflects the text's focus on the impact of minimum wage on worker earnings.

"Here's why the label **FAIRNESS** is appropriate for this text:

1. **Focus on ""Fairness"":** The phrase ""the fair thing to do"" directly emphasizes the ethical and moral dimension of the minimum wage debate.  The proponents believe raising the minimum wage is a just action towards American workers. 

2. **Tying to Inflation:** Suggesting that the minimum wage should be ""tied to inflation"" further supports the notion of fairness. This mechanism aims to ensure that wages keep pace with the cost of living, preventing workers from falling behind economically and experiencing hardship.

"Here's why the label **[INFLATION]** is correct for this text:

1. **Direct Comparison:** The sentence explicitly compares the minimum wage to ""inflation"" using the phrase ""hasn't kept up with inflation"". This highlights a direct relationship between these two economic factors. 

2. **Purchasing Power:**  The implication is that due to inflation, the purchasing power of the minimum wage has eroded over time. This aligns with the concept of how inflation diminishes the value of money.

1. **Focus on Unskilled Workers:** The sentence explicitly mentions ""unskilled workers"" and how a minimum wage increase might affect their employment prospects. This directly relates to the skills and education level of workers, which are key components of the [SKILLS/EDUCATION] category.
2. **Potential Impact on Employment:**  The text suggests that employers may be less inclined to invest in unskilled workers if the minimum wage rises, potentially leading to them ""being squeezed out of the job market."" This highlights a potential consequence of minimum wage policy on the employment landscape for different skill levels. 

Therefore, given the focus on ""unskilled workers"" and the discussion of their potential exclusion from the job market due to a minimum wage increase, the label **[SKILLS/EDUCATION]** is most accurate.

This implies that a higher minimum wage (the ""large amount of money"") could have negatively impacted the speaker's employment opportunities.

2. **Link to Unemployment:**  The statement directly connects the potential for higher wages to reduced job availability (""I would not have gotten those jobs""). This suggests a relationship between minimum wage increases and unemployment rates.

3. **Personal Experience as Evidence:** The speaker uses their own experience as evidence to argue that artificially inflating wages could lead to fewer job opportunities.  While anecdotal, this perspective highlights the potential consequences of minimum wage hikes on employment.

2. **Minimum Wage as an Impediment:** The statement argues that minimum wage laws *prevent* these voluntary agreements from occurring. This implies that setting a legal floor for wages interferes with the natural process of employers and employees reaching mutually acceptable terms.

3. **Alignment with Codebook Definition:** The codebook likely defines **FREEDOM_OF_CONTRACT** as encompassing discussions about the impact of minimum wage on the ability of individuals to freely negotiate their employment contracts.

1. **Direct Impact on Earnings:** The sentence states, ""This makes poor consumers worse off in a direct sense, in that they can purchase less with their earnings."" This directly focuses on the effect of some external factor (presumably minimum wage changes) on the amount individuals can buy with their income.
2. **Purchasing Power Defined:** Purchasing power refers to the ability of a currency to purchase goods and services. The text explicitly highlights a reduction in this ability, stating that poor consumers can ""purchase less"".
3. **Codebook Alignment:**  The [PURCHASING_POWER] category likely encompasses discussions about how changes in wages or prices affect individuals' ability to afford necessities and maintain their living standards. This sentence aligns perfectly with such a definition.
