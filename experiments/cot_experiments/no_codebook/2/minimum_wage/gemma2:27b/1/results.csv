"Here's why the label **[UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE]** is appropriate for this text:

1. **Wage Floor and Labor Supply:** The passage equates a minimum wage law with a restriction on workers entering certain jobs unless they find employers willing to pay the mandated wage. This highlights how a minimum wage acts as a floor, potentially limiting employment opportunities if wages are set above market equilibrium.

2. **Implication of Unemployment:** By stating that workers can't work in the protected sector ""unless they can find employers willing to hire them at that wage,"" the text implies a potential scenario where some individuals might be priced out of jobs due to the minimum wage, leading to increased unemployment. 

3. **Connection to Economic Theory:** The passage draws a parallel between a minimum wage and other legal restrictions. This framing suggests an understanding of labor market dynamics and how artificial price floors can impact employment levels.

2. **Critique of Arbitrary Intervention:**  The phrase ""always arbitrary and almost never based on any sound economic/cost-benefit analysis"" criticizes minimum wage laws as interventions that disrupt free market mechanisms. This argument directly touches on the core principle of market efficiency, which suggests that markets function best without artificial constraints.

3. **Local Specificity:** The text emphasizes that market-determined wages ""reflect supply and demand conditions ... specific to local market conditions"".

1. **Direct Focus on Wages:** The sentence starts with ""What we mean by this is that if wages are risen too much..."" clearly establishing the central topic as wage increases. 

2. **Consequences of Wage Increases:** The rest of the sentence outlines potential consequences of excessively high wages: employers struggling to offer incentives like sign-on bonuses, Christmas bonuses, or extra commission. These are all directly tied to the level of wages offered.

3. **Codebook Alignment:** The codebook likely defines **WAGES** as encompassing discussions about wage levels, changes in wages (increases or decreases), and the impacts of those changes on businesses and employees. This text aligns perfectly with that definition.

2. **Not Directly About Specific Aspects:** While the text touches upon potential benefits (easing hardship), it doesn't delve into specifics like price changes ([PRICES]), turnover ([TURNOVER]), or unemployment ([UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE]). 

3. **Broader Impact:** The phrase ""not abolish it"" suggests that the impact, while positive, is not a complete solution. This points to a more nuanced understanding of the consequences rather than a focus on a single aspect like prices or employment.

1. **Focus on Treatment:** The sentence explicitly mentions treating ""employees fairly"". This directly aligns with the core concept of employee treatment and well-being.

"The correct label for this text is **[WEALTH_DISTRIBUTION]**. Here's why:

1. **Focus on Wealth:** The sentence explicitly discusses ""the share of wealth created from productivity"" and how it's been distributed. 
2. **Change in Distribution:** It highlights a trend where workers are receiving a smaller portion of the wealth generated by increased productivity since the 1970s. This points to an issue of unequal distribution of wealth.
3. **Relevance to Codebook:** The  `[WEALTH_DISTRIBUTION]` category deals with how income and wealth are divided among different segments of society, including the impact of factors like minimum wage on this distribution.

The text directly addresses a shift in wealth distribution away from workers, making  `[WEALTH_DISTRIBUTION]` the most appropriate label.

* **Focus on Teen Employment:** The sentence directly addresses the impact of a minimum wage increase on ""teen employment,"" stating that it leads to a ""3-5% drop."" 

* **Correlation with Unemployment:** While not explicitly mentioning ""unemployment rate,""  the decrease in teen employment is a clear indicator of a potential rise in unemployment, particularly within that demographic.

* **Quantitative Impact:** The study provides quantifiable data (""10% increase"" leading to ""3-5% drop""), reinforcing the link between minimum wage changes and employment outcomes.

"Let's analyze why **PRODUCTIVITY** is the most suitable label for this text:

1. **Efficiency Focus:** The sentence states that ""raising wages simply spurs them [businesses] to become more efficient."" This emphasizes the potential impact of wage increases on business productivity and efficiency measures.
2. **Avoiding Staff Cuts:** The phrase ""instead of forcing businesses to cut staff"" suggests that businesses might find alternative solutions, such as improving efficiency, to accommodate higher labor costs.

"Let's analyze why **[PRICES]** is the appropriate label for this text:

1. **Direct Link to Prices:** The sentence explicitly states that retailers ""may find that they will raise prices"" in response to a wage increase. This directly addresses the impact of minimum wage on consumer prices. 

2. **Codebook Alignment:**  The codebook definition for [PRICES] includes mentions of:
    * Minimum wages effect on consumer prices or cost increases for the public in general
    * ""Higher prices cancel positive effects of minimum wage.""

 The text aligns perfectly with this by outlining a potential price increase as a consequence of a wage hike.

1. **Focus on Government Intervention:** The sentence argues against ""government control and fiat"" in setting wages. This directly addresses the role of policy and regulations in determining wage levels.

2. **Advocating for Market-Based Solutions:** The phrase ""let the terms and conditions of wages be set by mutual agreement""  promotes a free market approach where wages are determined through negotiations between employers and employees.
