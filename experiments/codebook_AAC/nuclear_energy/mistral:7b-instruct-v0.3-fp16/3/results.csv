" [CLIMATE CHANGE]
The aspect here is ""Climate Change"" as the text mentions the rapid approach of a climate change disaster. The sentence discusses the urgency to bring nuclear power plants online, which can be related to discussions about energy policy and renewables, but in this case, the main focus is on the impact of climate change.

[ENERGY POLICY]
The text also references governmental plans and actions regarding CO2 emissions, making it an aspect under ""Energy Policy"". It implies a need for nuclear power as part of the policy to combat climate change.
