" In this given example, there are multiple aspects present in the sentence. Here's a breakdown:

1. [ECONOMIC IMPACT]: Raising the federal minimum wage is an important part of **strengthening the economy**. This suggests that the aspect related to the overall effect on the economy is being discussed.

2. [SOCIAL JUSTICE/INJUSTICE]: The phrase ""strengthening the economy"" can also be associated with aspects such as social justice or fairness in society, as a stronger economy might lead to improved living conditions for many people. However, without further context, it's hard to definitively say that this is the primary aspect being discussed here.

3. [WELFARE]: There's no clear mention of welfare spending or its relationship with minimum wage in this sentence, so it's not applicable in this case.

4. [PRICES]: The sentence doesn't directly discuss consumer prices or cost increases due to a rising minimum wage, so this aspect isn't present here.

5. [COMPETITION/BUSINESS CHALLENGES]: While the economy is mentioned, there's no specific discussion about business challenges related to competition or employment rates, so this aspect doesn't apply either.

6. [CAPITAL VS LABOR]: There's no explicit reference to power disparities between workers and company owners in this sentence, so this aspect isn't present here.

7. [GOVERNMENT]: The phrase ""federal minimum wage"" suggests government intervention into wage setting, but there's no clear agreement or disagreement with state intervention expressed in the sentence, so this aspect isn't the primary focus.

8. [UN/EMPLOYMENT RATE]: The sentence doesn't discuss job creation, job loss, labor supply, outsourcing, or automation directly, so this aspect isn't present here.

9. [LOW-SKILLED]: While not explicitly stated, the federal minimum wage generally applies to low-skilled workers, so this aspect can be inferred but it's not the primary focus of the sentence.

10. [YOUTH AND SECONDARY WAGE EARNERS]: The sentence doesn't mention teenagers or part-time workers specifically, so this aspect isn't applicable here.

However, it is more directly related to the business challenges that minimum wage increase might impose on the restaurants.
- [COMPETITION/BUSINESS CHALLENGES]: The sentence explicitly states that raising the federal tipped minimum wage would hurt restaurants, which suggests a competitive challenge or financial difficulty for businesses due to higher labor costs.
- [PRICES]: Higher labor costs due to minimum wage increases could potentially lead to increased consumer prices, but this is not directly mentioned in the sentence.
- [SOCIAL JUSTICE/INJUSTICE]: There is no clear reference to social justice or fairness in this sentence, but it is possible that some arguments about raising the minimum wage might touch upon these aspects.
- [WELFARE]: The sentence does not discuss any welfare implications of the minimum wage change.
- [CAPITAL VS LABOR]: There is no explicit mention of power disparity or class warfare in this sentence.
- [GOVERNMENT]: The sentence refers to a federal regulation, making it relevant to government intervention into wage setting.
- [UN/EMPLOYMENT RATE]: While the sentence does not explicitly discuss employment or unemployment rates, a potential effect of raising the minimum wage could be on job creation or loss in the restaurant industry.
- [LOW-SKILLED]: As the discussion is about tipped minimum wage for restaurant workers, it can be considered as related to low-skilled workers.
