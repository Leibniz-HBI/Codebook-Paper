This label captures the aspect of how minimum wage affects employee turnover.

**ECONOMIC IMPACT**: The text mentions the ""immediate effects of the wage increases"", which implies an economic impact. Specifically, it suggests that the increase in minimum wage has a direct effect on the economy, likely leading to changes in employment rates, consumer behavior, or business operations.

**SOCIAL JUSTICE/INJUSTICE**: The text highlights the issue of people making as little as $9/hour, which raises concerns about fairness and social justice. It implies that the current wages are not sufficient for a decent standard of living, which is a key aspect of social justice/injustice.

* **WELFARE**: While it's possible to argue that welfare spending might be affected by minimum wage increases, this label is not explicitly mentioned in the text.

This directly relates to the aspect of `UN/EMPLOYMENT RATE`, which concerns the effects of minimum wage on employment or unemployment rates.
* Additionally, the sentence is discussing an economic impact of a policy change (raising the minimum wage), which affects the economy in general. This falls under the aspect of `ECONOMIC IMPACT`.

Note that other aspects may also be relevant to some extent (e.g., `GOVERNMENT`, as it mentions a specific city's office analyzing data related to minimum wage changes), but the primary focus of this sentence is on employment and economic impact, making `UN/EMPLOYMENT RATE` and `ECONOMIC IMPACT` the most directly applicable labels.",llama3.1:8b-instruct-fp16,2024-09-12T08:27:26.219250009Z,stop,5518912032,29850284,1586,36137000,238,5363829000,"San Francisco 's Office of Economic Analysis said that an increase to $ 15 would reduce the city 's employment by about "" 15,270 private sector jobs .

* The mention of ""competitive wage"" implies a discussion about the minimum wage, which is closely related to consumer prices (in this case, wages). This aligns with the **[PRICES]** category.

This implies an economic impact, as it affects the way businesses operate and make decisions about labor.

Additionally, I considered other labels such as **[CAPITAL VS LABOR]** or **[COMPETITION/BUSINESS CHALLENGES]**, but they do not seem to apply directly in this case.

Therefore, I assigned the [CAPITAL VS LABOR] label.

Additionally, the text mentions ""basic income"", which is related to welfare. The basic income is a type of government benefit or subsidy that would provide recipients with a safety net in case they don't take employment.

* `[COMPETITION/BUSINESS CHALLENGES]`: This aspect is relevant because the text mentions that a wage increase for all employees may financially hurt the company until it can adjust or permanently. This implies that businesses may struggle with increased labor costs, which fits under the category of business challenges.
* `[UN/EMPLOYMENT RATE]`: The text also implies that employers might respond to financial strain by giving temporary or permanent layoffs, which directly affects employment rates.

`[COMPETITION/BUSINESS CHALLENGES], [UN/EMPLOYMENT RATE]`

The sentence mentions that Burger King and McDonald's ""can raise their prices a little bit"" due to the potential minimum wage increase. This is an example of how a minimum wage affects consumer prices or cost increases for the public in general, which falls under the category of **[PRICES]**.

* **[ECONOMIC IMPACT]**
	+ This label also applies as the text discusses the potential economic impact of minimum wage increases on businesses, specifically their bottom line.

"After carefully reviewing the codebook and analyzing the provided text, I have assigned the following labels:

* **CAPITAL VS LABOR**: This label applies because the text mentions the concept of ""freedom of contract"" as a constitutional right that may be violated by minimum wage laws. This implies a power disparity between workers (labor) and company owners (capital).
* **GOVERNMENT**: This label is relevant because the text refers to a Supreme Court opinion and its interpretation of the constitution, indicating state intervention into wage setting.
* **SOCIAL JUSTICE/INJUSTICE**: Although not explicitly stated, the context suggests that the argument made by the Supreme Court in Adkins v. Children's Hospital of District of Columbia may be perceived as promoting or defending the interests of capital over labor, potentially perpetuating social injustice.

I did not assign any other labels because they do not seem to apply directly to the provided text. For example:

* **COMPETITION/BUSINESS CHALLENGES**: While this label might be relevant in a broader discussion about minimum wage laws, it is not explicitly mentioned or implied in this particular text.

"After carefully reading the provided markdown codebook and analyzing the given example sentence, I would assign the following labels:

* **SOCIAL JUSTICE/INJUSTICE**
	+ Reason: The text mentions treating employees ""fairly"", which is related to the aspect of fairness in society (social justice/injustice).
* **WELFARE**
	+ Reason: While not explicitly mentioned, the context suggests that fair treatment of employees may lead to increased job satisfaction and potentially reduce reliance on welfare. However, this label could be subjective, so I will only assign it if there is a clear indication that the author is considering how minimum wage affects welfare spending.

I did not assign any other labels because:

* **MOTIVATION/CHANCES**: While the sentence does mention treating employees fairly, which may motivate workers, the primary focus of the sentence appears to be on social justice rather than motivation.

"After analyzing the given sentence, I would assign the following labels:

* **CAPITAL VS LABOR**: This label applies because the text mentions a power disparity between workers and company owners, where less of the share of wealth created from productivity has been going towards workers.
* **ECONOMIC IMPACT**: This label also applies because the text discusses the effects of increased productivity on the distribution of wealth in the economy.

These labels are assigned because they best capture the essence of the argument presented in the sentence. The text is not explicitly discussing minimum wage, but it touches on a related issue: the distribution of wealth and power between workers and company owners, which can be linked to debates about labor rights and economic justice.

Explanation:
* The mention of ""teenagers"" and ""drop in teen employment"" suggests that the text is referring to low-skilled workers (LOW-SKILLED).
* The phrase ""3-5% drop"" implies an economic impact, specifically on the job market or labor supply, which falls under ECONOMIC IMPACT.
* The mention of ""teen employment"" and the potential consequences for teenagers entering the workforce also relates to unemployment rates, so I've added UN/EMPLOYMENT RATE as a relevant label.

"A fascinating task!

After carefully reading the example sentence and consulting the codebook, I would assign the following labels:

* **COMPETITION/BUSINESS CHALLENGES**: This label applies because the sentence mentions how a potential increase in minimum wage (raising wages) might lead businesses to become more efficient, implying that this is a challenge or concern for businesses.
* **ECONOMIC IMPACT**: This label also applies as the sentence discusses the potential effects of raising wages on businesses (becoming more efficient), which has broader economic implications.
