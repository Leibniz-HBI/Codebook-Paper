2. HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS - A study published in the Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology found that chronic marijuana use during adolescence could impair cognitive function in adulthood.
3. MEDICAL_MARIJUANA, PERSONAL_FREEDOM - Some argue that legalizing marijuana for medical purposes allows patients to have access to a treatment option that can alleviate symptoms of certain conditions, while also respecting their personal autonomy and right to choose their own healthcare.
4. HARM - According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, marijuana use has been linked to an increased risk of mental health problems such as schizophrenia and other psychoses, especially in those with a family history of these disorders.
5. LEGAL_DRUGS - The legalization of marijuana would remove it from the illicit drug market and regulate its production, distribution, and use like other legal substances.
6. CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY - Critics argue that the easy availability of marijuana could lead to increased use among children and teens, which could have negative consequences for their cognitive development and overall health.
7. ADDICTION - According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, about 9% of users develop an addiction to marijuana, with the risk being higher among those who start using it at a young age.
8. DRUG_ABUSE - Some argue that legalizing marijuana would make it easier for individuals with substance abuse problems to access the drug, potentially exacerbating their addiction and increasing the overall burden on healthcare systems.
9. GATEWAY_DRUG - Critics of marijuana legalization argue that using marijuana can lead to the use of other, more dangerous substances, such as cocaine or heroin.
10. COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS - The legalization of marijuana could have a variety of community and social effects, including changes in crime rates, tax revenue, and attitudes towards drug use.
