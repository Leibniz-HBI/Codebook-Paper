The text provided mentions ""unintended negative consequences"" of drug enforcement, which could be interpreted as referring to both the health and psychological effects on individuals (as people may resort to harmful methods to acquire drugs illegally), the socio-economic impact on communities (illegal trade can lead to increased crime rates and social issues), and the policy implications (the current drug policies may not effectively address these negative consequences). Therefore, the labels HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS, DRUG_POLICY, COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS, and ILLEGAL_TRADE are assigned to this text.

The text indicates that Kerlikowske, the ONDCP Director, spoke at a California Police Chiefs Conference about why marijuana legalization would compromise public health and public safety. He argues that legalization would lead to increased marijuana usage among youth, exacerbate drug abuse and addiction, increase harmful effects on brain development, and pose challenges for community and societal safety. Furthermore, he suggests that legalizing marijuana could have financial implications at the national level due to increased healthcare costs associated with its use.
