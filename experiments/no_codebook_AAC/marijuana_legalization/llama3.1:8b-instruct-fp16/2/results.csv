* The mention of a ""little girl"" and her reaction to seeing pot candies suggests that the scenario could be seen as a concern for child safety, particularly in terms of exposure to substances they shouldn't have access to.
* The image of pink pot candies being displayed next to a toy store implies that marijuana products are being made appealing and accessible to children, which could contribute to the normalization of its use.
