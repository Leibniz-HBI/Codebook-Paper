* **ACCIDENTS/SECURITY:**  The reference to Chernobyl, a site of a major nuclear accident, directly relates to this aspect.
* **HEALTH_EFFECTS:** While the sentence focuses on wildlife flourishing, it implicitly acknowledges the potential health effects (""fallout"") associated with a nuclear accident.
