Let me explain my reasoning:

* **RENEWABLES:** The sentence contrasts ""nuclear"" with ""true renewables"", clearly positioning renewable energy sources as an alternative.
* **ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT:** The mention of melting glaciers and polar ice caps directly relates to the environmental consequences of climate change, a key concern in debates surrounding nuclear energy's impact.

Let's break down why:

* **FOSSIL_FUELS:** The sentence explicitly mentions ""dirty coal"" which is a type of fossil fuel. This indicates the argument is positioning nuclear energy as an alternative to fossil fuels.
* **ENERGY_POLICY:**  The phrase ""nuclear energy is the primary alternative..."" suggests a discussion about energy choices and policy decisions, making ENERGY_POLICY relevant. 
* **RENEWABLES:** While not directly stated, the implication that nuclear energy is a *primary* alternative points towards a comparison with other energy sources like renewables.
