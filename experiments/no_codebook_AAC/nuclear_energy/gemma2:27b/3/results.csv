Let me explain my reasoning:

* **ACCIDENTS/SECURITY:** The phrase ""eliminates the possibility of diversion"" points towards security measures designed to prevent misuse of nuclear materials, directly addressing concerns about accidents and security.
* **WASTE:**  The mention of ""breeder and burner configurations"" implies a focus on managing spent nuclear fuel (waste) through reprocessing and transmutation.

Let me explain my reasoning:

* **RENEWABLES:** The sentence explicitly contrasts ""nuclear"" with ""true renewables,"" indicating a comparison between these two energy sources.
* **ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT:** The phrase ""the glaciers and polar ice caps will keep melting"" directly refers to the environmental consequences of climate change, a key concern related to energy production choices.
