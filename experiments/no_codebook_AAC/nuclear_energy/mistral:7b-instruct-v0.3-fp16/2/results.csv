Explanation: In this sentence, ""dirty coal"" is being contrasted with ""nuclear energy,"" implying a debate about cleaner energy sources. The mention of nuclear energy as an alternative suggests that it's being considered in the context of energy policy. As nuclear power does involve risks such as accidents, the ACCIDENTS/SECURITY label applies as well. The contrast with ""dirty coal"" also implies some discussion about environmental impact, but since the text itself doesn't mention any specific environmental effects, the ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT label isn't explicitly applicable here. However, since nuclear energy is often compared to renewable energy sources in debates, the RENEWABLES label is also included. Lastly, the Fossil Fuels label is added because coal is a fossil fuel and the comparison implies a context where nuclear energy is being discussed as an alternative to it.",mistral:7b-instruct-v0.3-fp16,2024-09-11T14:23:42.500603398Z,stop,4684770169,49795729,215,23660000,228,4564427000,Nuclear energy is the primary alternative to dirty coal Patrick Moore .,['FOSSIL_FUELS'],5,"['FOSSIL_FUELS', 'ACCIDENTS/SECURITY', 'ENERGY_POLICY', 'RENEWABLES', 'ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT']"
