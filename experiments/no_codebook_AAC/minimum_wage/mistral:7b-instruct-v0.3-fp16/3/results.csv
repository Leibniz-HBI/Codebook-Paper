The reasoning behind these labels:
1. Economic Impact: The statement discusses the financial implications of wage increases on a company, with potential consequences such as investment in labor-saving machinery and job losses.
2. Capital vs Labor: The manager's concern about investing in labor-saving machinery suggests a focus on capital over labor, which is a common theme in debates involving minimum wage.
3. Competition/Business Challenges: The threat of implementing labor-saving machinery due to wage increases indicates competition pressures that businesses may face when it comes to keeping costs low.
4.
