Let me explain why:

* **LOW-SKILLED:** The phrase ""low-wage workers"" directly points to individuals often categorized as having low skills. This is a common demographic discussed in minimum wage debates. 

While the text mentions Republicans and stagnant incomes, these elements don't align strongly enough with the other codebook categories to warrant inclusion.

**Explanation:**

This sentence highlights the significant contribution minimum wage workers make to their households (46%), implying a concern for their economic well-being and fairness.  The fact that over half work full-time suggests these are not just temporary or supplemental jobs, further supporting the social justice angle. The statement also indirectly points to the ""LOW_SKILLED"" category as minimum wage jobs are often associated with lower-skilled labor.

"GOVERNMENT, CAPITAL_VS_LABOR 

**Explanation:**

* **GOVERNMENT:** The passage discusses a Supreme Court decision, directly involving a governmental institution.
* **CAPITAL_VS_LABOR:** The argument centers on freedom of contract, which is a key issue in the debate between capital (employers) and labor (employees).  The minimum wage is seen as potentially infringing on the employer's right to freely negotiate wages.

"CAPITAL_VS_LABOR, SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE  


**Explanation:**

* **CAPITAL_VS_LABOR:** The sentence highlights a disparity in how the benefits of increased productivity are distributed, suggesting a tension between capital owners (who benefit from increased wealth) and laborers (who receive a smaller share).
* **SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE:** The statement implies an unfair distribution of wealth, raising concerns about social justice as workers are not adequately rewarded for their contributions to productivity.
