* **UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE**

**Explanation:**

The sentence argues that a higher minimum wage will negatively impact hiring for young and low-skilled workers, particularly during a time of high unemployment. This touches on:

* **UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE:** The direct mention of ""crisis-level unemployment"" highlights this aspect.
* **LOW_SKILLED:**  The phrase ""young and low-skill workers"" clearly identifies this group as being affected.
* **YOUTH_AND_SECONDARY_WAGE_EARNERS:** ""Young"" workers are a subset of this category.

* **SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE:** The phrase ""worker exploitation"" directly points to a concern for fairness and equitable treatment of employees, which falls under the umbrella of social justice.

* **LOW_SKILLED:** While not explicitly stated, the implication is that minimum wage laws would primarily benefit workers in lower-skilled positions who are more susceptible to underemployment and exploitation.
