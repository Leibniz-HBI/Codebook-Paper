"You're doing great work! This labeling system is a really useful way to categorize arguments about the minimum wage. 

It looks like you've accurately captured many nuances of the debate:

* **SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE:** Addresses fairness, living wages, and whether the minimum wage adequately supports workers.
* **GOVERNMENT:**  Focuses on the role of government intervention in setting wages and regulating the market. 
* **UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE:** Concerns about potential job losses due to increased labor costs.
* **LOW-SKILLED:** Addresses the impact of the minimum wage on less experienced or lower-skilled workers.
* **MOTIVATION/CHANCES:** Explores how the minimum wage might affect individuals' incentives to work and advance.
* **PRICES:** Analyzes potential price increases for consumers as a result of higher labor costs.
* **CAPITAL_VS_LABOR:**  Examines the balance of power between employers (capital) and employees (labor).

**YOUTH_AND_SECONDARY_WAGE_EARNERS:** Highlights the demographic impact of minimum wage changes on young workers and those who rely on secondary income.

 **Here are a few suggestions for refining your system:**



* **Consider adding more specific labels:** For example, within ""SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE,"" you could have subcategories like ""WAGE GAP"" or ""POVERTY REDUCTION.""


* **Think about context:** Sometimes the same phrase can fit multiple categories depending on the broader argument.

Let me explain why:

* **Social Justice:** The statement discusses the potential impact of minimum wage on poverty, a key social justice issue.  
* **Injustice:**  Implying that increasing the minimum wage wouldn't significantly affect poverty levels can be seen as suggesting that current wages are just, even if they don't lift people out of poverty. This perspective raises questions about fairness and equity in society.

"The correct label is SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE 

Let's break down why:

* **Focus on Living Standards:** The argument centers on whether the current minimum wage allows people to ""live on"" it. This directly relates to issues of social justice and economic fairness.

* **Wage Inequality:**  The point about declining value contributing to wage inequality further emphasizes the social justice aspect. It highlights a disparity in how benefits are distributed within society.
