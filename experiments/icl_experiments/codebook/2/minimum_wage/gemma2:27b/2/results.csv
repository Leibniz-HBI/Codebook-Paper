"Your labeling system is doing a great job capturing the nuances of arguments for and against raising the minimum wage. Here's why it works and some suggestions for improvement:

**Strengths:**

* **Specificity:** Labels like ""LOW-SKILLED,"" ""UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE,"" and ""CAPITAL_VS_LABOR"" pinpoint the core issues being debated.
* **Alignment with Arguments:** Each label accurately reflects the point the text is trying to make (e.g., ""GOVERNMENT"" for arguments about state intervention).
* **Balance:**  You've included labels representing both sides of the debate, showcasing the complexity of the issue.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

* **Granularity:** Consider adding more specific sub-categories within broader labels. For example:
    * Under ""UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE,"" you could have ""JOB LOSS"" and ""WAGE STAGNATION.""
    * Under ""SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE,"" you might use ""LIVING WAGE"" or ""ECONOMIC DISPARITY.""

* **Contextual Labels:** Some statements could benefit from labels that capture the context of the argument. For instance:
   *  ""The team found no measurable price hike at all at grocery stores, gas stations or retail outlets."" This could be labeled as ""PRICE IMPACT/REFUTATION"" to show it's challenging a common concern about minimum wage increases.

**Overall:** Your labeling system is very effective.
