Let me explain my reasoning for this last example and how I've been applying the codebook instructions.

**Why ""COSTS"" is appropriate:**

The sentence states that ""The Jervis Bay plan eventually was dropped mainly due to economic considerations."" This directly points to financial reasons being the primary cause for abandoning the plan.  

 **How I'm using the codebook:**

For each input, I carefully read the sentence and look for keywords or phrases that match the descriptions in the codebook categories.  I prioritize the most prominent aspects mentioned. In some cases, multiple labels could apply, but I only select the ones that are clearly supported by the text.
