* **Input:** Read CND 's summary of the German government-commissioned research that shows increases in cancer in children under five living near nuclear power stations .
* **Output:**  The correct labels are **HEALTH_EFFECTS** and **PUBLIC_DEBATE**. 

**Explanation:**

* **HEALTH_EFFECTS:** The sentence explicitly mentions increased cancer rates near nuclear power stations, a clear health concern.
* **PUBLIC_DEBATE:** The phrase ""Read CND's summary"" indicates that this information is part of a larger discussion or debate about nuclear energy, likely involving the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND).

* **Connection to Potential Harm:** The text explicitly states these feelings arise due to the ""risk that their relatives may be harmed in a nuclear accident.""

Let me explain why this codebook and the examples are helpful for coding qualitative data.  This type of detailed codebook ensures consistency and reliability in your analysis. Here's a breakdown of how it works:

* **Clear Definitions:** Each aspect (like WASTE, HEALTH EFFECTS, COSTS) is precisely defined. This reduces ambiguity and makes sure different coders interpret the text similarly.
* **Example Terms:** The list of terms associated with each aspect gives you concrete examples to look for in the text.
* **Multiple Labels:** Recognizing that a single sentence can address multiple aspects allows for a richer understanding of the complexities within the argument.

**Remember:** Context is Key! Always read the entire sentence or short text unit carefully before assigning labels.
