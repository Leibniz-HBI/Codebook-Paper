Let me explain why:

* **Basic Income:** The text discusses a ""basic income,"" which is a social policy concept aimed at providing a guaranteed minimum income to all citizens.
* **Bargaining Power:** The argument highlights how basic income would empower individuals during wage negotiations because they wouldn't face the threat of poverty if they refused a job offer.

This scenario directly relates to ideas of fairness, economic justice, and reducing power imbalances between employers and employees – key themes within the  **SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE** category.

"The correct label is **SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE** 

Let me explain why:

* **The speaker's argument:** They are suggesting that minimum wage jobs don't actually require a lot of effort or skill, implying that people who deserve higher wages wouldn't be stuck in those positions. This reflects a belief that the value of work should be reflected in the wage, which is a core principle of social justice.
* **Government intervention:**  The speaker also criticizes government intervention in setting wages. This implies a viewpoint on the role of government in ensuring fair treatment and compensation for workers.

While the passage touches on other themes like individual effort and responsibility, the underlying argument centers around the fairness and appropriateness of minimum wage levels – a social justice issue.
