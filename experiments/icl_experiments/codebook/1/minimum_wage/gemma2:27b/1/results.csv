* **PRICES:** The phrase ""a tax on everyone"" suggests that the increased labor costs from a higher minimum wage will likely be passed onto consumers through higher prices for goods and services.

Let me explain why:

* **LOW-SKILLED:** The passage discusses teenagers withdrawing from the labor force in response to a higher minimum wage. This directly relates to the impact of minimum wage on low-skilled and entry-level workers, who often include teenagers.

* **YOUTH_AND_SECONDARY_WAGE_EARNERS:**  The text specifically mentions ""teenagers"" withdrawing from the labor force. This clearly falls under the category of youth and secondary wage earners.

Here's why:

* **SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE:**  The phrase ""less of the share of wealth created... has been going towards workers"" implies an unfair distribution of wealth, raising concerns about social justice.
