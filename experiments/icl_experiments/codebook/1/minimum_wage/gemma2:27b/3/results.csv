"The correct label is **LOW-SKILLED** and **YOUTH_AND_SECONDARY_WAGE_EARNERS**. 

Here's why:

* **LOW-SKILLED:** The text discusses teenagers withdrawing from the labor force in response to a minimum wage increase. This implies an impact on low-skilled, entry-level workers who are often teenagers.
* **YOUTH_AND_SECONDARY_WAGE_EARNERS:** The specific mention of ""teenagers"" and their withdrawal from the labor force clearly falls under this category.

"The correct label is **UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE**  

Let me explain why:

* **Focus:** The passage directly addresses the impact of a minimum wage increase on employment levels in specific industries (restaurant and retail). 
* **Key Phrase:** ""boosting the minimum wage by 10 percent had effectively no impact on employment levels"" This statement explicitly links minimum wage to employment outcomes.

Let me explain why:

The statement challenges the idea of a purely ""free market"" taking care of workers. This implies a critique of existing economic systems and suggests that intervention (like minimum wage) might be necessary to ensure fairness and justice for workers.
