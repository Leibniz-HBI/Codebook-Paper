Let me explain my reasoning for each example you provided:

* **In 2000 , there were six times as many emergency room mentions of marijuana use as there were in 1990 , despite the fact that the number of people using marijuana is roughly the same .**  
    * This focuses on the negative health consequences associated with marijuana use, hence **HARM**.

* **A world where instead of drinking cheap beer , a hopeful political candidate can roll a joint to seem like the "" people ' s choice "" does n't have to seem crazy .** 
    * This sentence compares marijuana to legal drugs (alcohol), advocating for its acceptance and legalization. The correct label is **LEGAL_DRUGS**.

* **The United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime has also acknowledged the many "" unintended negative consequences "" of drug enforcement .**
    * This statement highlights the broader societal impact of drug policies, implying potential downsides to current enforcement strategies.  **COMMUNITY/SOCIETAL_EFFECTS** is appropriate. 

* **Even smoking weed at home will allow the drug to make its way to others , especially if it is a multi-level apartment complex .**
