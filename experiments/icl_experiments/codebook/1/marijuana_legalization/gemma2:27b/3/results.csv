* **Why ILLEGAL_TRADE Fits:** This sentence directly connects the low usage of marijuana to its illegal status. It implies that if marijuana were legal, usage levels might be higher. This aligns with the idea that illegal trade (often controlled by criminal organizations) is a factor influencing drug availability and use.
