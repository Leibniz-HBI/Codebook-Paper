"The correct label is **ACCIDENTS/SECURITY** 


Let's break down why:

* **Focus on Disaster:** The sentence directly references a ""nuclear calamity"" in Fukushima, clearly pointing to an accident or security breach related to nuclear power.

* **Quantitative Example:** The use of specific numbers (""3,000 megawatt-electric,"" ""2,000 wind turbines,"" ""140 square kilometers"") underscores a quantitative comparison often used when discussing the viability of different energy sources.

While other aspects like COSTS or ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT might be tangentially related to this comparison, the core focus of the sentence is on establishing a relationship between nuclear and renewable energy production.

Let's break down why:

* **COSTS:** The text explicitly mentions ""supporting financially struggling, aging reactors"" indicating a concern about the economic viability and costs associated with nuclear energy.
* **ENERGY POLICY:**  The passage discusses actions taken by states (""Illinois, New York and now Connecticut"") to provide financial support to nuclear reactors. This highlights governmental intervention and policy decisions regarding nuclear energy.

"The correct label is ACCIDENTS/SECURITY 


Let me explain why some of these might be tricky:

* **""Nuclear power is not a near-term solution to the challenge of climate change""**: While this touches on environmental impact, it's more directly about **RELIABILITY**.  The statement implies nuclear power isn't quick enough to address the urgent need for climate solutions.

* **""This causes utilities to operate nuclear power plants in an up and down mode rather than their normal baseload operation, making them even less competitive.""**: This focuses on the **COSTS** of operating nuclear plants due to fluctuating energy demands.
