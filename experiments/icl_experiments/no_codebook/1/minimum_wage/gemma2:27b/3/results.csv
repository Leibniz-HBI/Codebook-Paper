Let me explain my reasoning for each coded example:

* **""Thus this price effect may harm the very people whom a minimum wage is supposed to help.""**  Increasing the minimum wage can lead to higher prices, which hurts consumers. This directly relates to the **PRICES** label.
* **""According to the Economic Policy Institute, the minimum wage in the United States would have been $18.28 in 2013 if the minimum wage had kept pace with labor productivity.""** This statement argues that the current minimum wage is insufficient compared to historical trends and worker productivity. It aligns with the **SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE** label, as it implies a fairness issue regarding wages.
* **""If there is an increase in a minimum wage, it could have far-reaching effects on industries that don't pay it.""** Raising the minimum wage can create competitive pressure for businesses even those not directly subject to the wage change. This fits under  **COMPETITION/BUSINESS_CHALLENGES**. 
* **""After the president's speech, House Speaker John Boehner argued that raising the minimum wage would raise unemployment.""** This statement explicitly links a minimum wage increase to potential job losses, making **UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE** the appropriate label.
* **""Not true: Academic research has shown that higher wages sharply reduce employee turnover which can reduce employment and training costs.""**  Lowering employee turnover is a benefit often cited in favor of raising the minimum wage. This aligns with the **TURNOVER** label. 
* **""A 2014 study by Alex Smith, PhD, Assistant Professor of Economics at the United States Military Academy at West Point, found that 'an increase in the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10.10 (39%) ... would lead to a 2-4 percentage point decrease in the likelihood that a low-SES [socio-economic status] teen will drop out.'""** This example focuses on the potential educational benefits for low-income youth, aligning with **MOTIVATION/CHANCES**.
*  **""About 70 percent of minimum wage employees, however, work fewer than 35 hours per week and thus earn proportionately less, according to federal labor statistics.""** This statement highlights the prevalence of part-time work among minimum wage earners, making **YOUTH_AND_SECONDARY_WAGE_EARNERS** suitable.
* **""The minimum wage will price the services of the least productive (and therefore lowest-wage) workers out of the market.""** This argument suggests that a higher minimum wage could lead to job losses for less skilled workers, connecting it to the  **LOW-SKILLED** label.
* **""That last argument is underscored by the exorbitant salaries earned by CEOs and other corporate titans, which are also the same people generally arguing against an increase in the minimum wage.""** This statement draws a contrast between high executive compensation and opposition to raising the minimum wage, reflecting the **CAPITAL_VS_LABOR** debate. 
* **""This knee-jerk response to look to the government to solve all of our problems is simply untenable and indefensible.""** This expresses a criticism towards government intervention in the labor market, aligning with the **GOVERNMENT** label.
* **""If politicians want to increase the earned income tax credit or other work-related welfare benefits, they should do the hard work of building political support for such policies, rather than choosing the roundabout approach of a minimum wage increase.""**  This statement suggests alternative solutions to addressing low wages besides raising the minimum wage, pointing to **WELFARE**.
* **""Myth: Increasing the minimum wage is bad for the economy.""** This directly addresses a common argument against raising the minimum wage, linking it to the **ECONOMIC_IMPACT** label.

* **""Saying we have a 'free market' that will take care of workers is a myth.""** This statement challenges the idea that the free market alone adequately protects worker interests, implying a critique of the balance between **CAPITAL_VS_LABOR**.
