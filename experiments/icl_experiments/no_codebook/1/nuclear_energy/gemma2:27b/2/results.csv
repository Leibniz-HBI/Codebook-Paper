Let me explain my reasoning for each labeling decision.  Understanding the context and nuances in these sentences is crucial for accurate coding:


* **""One of the interesting things about modern nuclear power in the US is that few really understand how it works day to day -- including most experts who are commenting to the media on the topic .""** This sentence focuses on the lack of public understanding surrounding nuclear technology, pointing directly to **PUBLIC_DEBATE**.

* **""Do we really want to invest in more fission technology , LFTR and similar , when LENR do not have these problems ?""** This statement compares different nuclear technologies (fission vs. LENR), highlighting the aspect of **TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION**.

* **""“ Nuclear power is not a near-term solution to the challenge of climate change , ” writes Sharon Squassoni in the IAEA bulletin .""**  The quote explicitly links nuclear power to its role in mitigating climate change, thus falling under **ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT**. 

* **""How long can we expect supplies of Uranium and nuclear energy to last ?""** This question centers on the longevity and sustainability of nuclear fuel, which relates directly to **RELIABILITY**.

*  **""The intimate connection between nuclear power production and nuclear weapons is inescapable .""** This statement makes a clear link between civilian nuclear power and the potential for weapons proliferation, making **WEAPONS** the appropriate label.

* **""This causes utilities to operate nuclear power plants in an up and down mode rather than their normal baseload operation , making them even less competitive .""** The sentence discusses the economic implications of nuclear power plant operations, leading to the label **COSTS**.

* **""It remains up to nuclear and renewable energies to fill the gap .""** This statement positions nuclear energy alongside renewables as solutions, indicating **RENEWABLES**.

* **""Wastes are contained and managed , not released .""**  This sentence addresses how nuclear waste is handled, directly relating to **WASTE**. 

* **""Replacing coal to limit global warming should not be based on another toxic product .""** This comparison between coal and nuclear power highlights the issue of environmental toxicity associated with energy sources, making **FOSSIL_FUELS** the relevant label.

* **""The U.S. department that would be in charge of such an operation is the same one that brought us the chaotic and ineffective evacuation of the much smaller city of New Orleans during the 2005 Hurricane Katrina debacle : the Department of Homeland Security .""** This passage criticizes the government agency responsible for nuclear energy policy, indicating **ENERGY_POLICY**.

* **""Read CND ' s summary of the German government-commissioned research that shows increases in cancer in children under five living near nuclear power stations .""** This statement links nuclear power plants to potential health risks, specifically childhood cancers, making **HEALTH_EFFECTS** the appropriate label.

*  **""Let ’s not exclude clean and safe nuclear energy .""** This sentence advocates for nuclear energy while emphasizing its safety and cleanliness, suggesting **ACCIDENTS/SECURITY**. 
* **""The nuclear phase-out is as much part of the Energiewende ( energy transition ) as the move towards a low-carbon economy .""** This statement positions the phasing out of nuclear power within a larger framework of energy policy and decarbonization goals, indicating **ENERGY_POLICY**.
