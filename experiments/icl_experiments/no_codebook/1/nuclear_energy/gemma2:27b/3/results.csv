Let me explain my reasoning for each choice:

* **""One of the interesting things about modern nuclear power in the US is that few really understand how it works day to day -- including most experts who are commenting to the media on the topic.""** This sentence discusses the lack of public understanding surrounding nuclear power, pointing to a deficit in  **PUBLIC_DEBATE**.

* **""Do we really want to invest in more fission technology , LFTR and similar , when LENR do not have these problems ?""**  This sentence compares different nuclear technologies (fission vs. LENR), highlighting the desire for technological advancement – **TECHNOLOGICAL_INNOVATION**. 

* **“Nuclear power is not a near-term solution to the challenge of climate change,” writes Sharon Squassoni in the IAEA bulletin.** This statement directly addresses the role of nuclear power in mitigating climate change, falling under **ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT**.

*  **""How long can we expect supplies of Uranium and nuclear energy to last ?""** This question focuses on the longevity and availability of nuclear fuel, directly relating to **RELIABILITY**.

* **""The intimate connection between nuclear power production and nuclear weapons is inescapable.""** This sentence explicitly links nuclear power with the potential for weapons development, making **WEAPONS** the appropriate label. 

*  **""This causes utilities to operate nuclear power plants in an up and down mode rather than their normal baseload operation , making them even less competitive .""** The sentence discusses the economic viability of nuclear power compared to other energy sources, indicating **COSTS**.

* **""It remains up to nuclear and renewable energies to fill the gap.""** This statement positions nuclear power alongside renewables as solutions for energy needs, pointing to **RENEWABLES**.

*  **""Wastes are contained and managed , not released .""** This sentence directly addresses the handling of nuclear waste, making **WASTE** the fitting label.

*  **""Replacing coal to limit global warming should not be based on another toxic product .""** The sentence contrasts coal with nuclear power, suggesting concerns about the environmental impact of both – **FOSSIL_FUELS**.

* **""The U.S. department that would be in charge of such an operation is the same one that brought us the chaotic and ineffective evacuation of the much smaller city of New Orleans during the 2005 Hurricane Katrina debacle : the Department of Homeland Security .""** This excerpt critiques the potential role of a government agency in managing nuclear power, falling under **ENERGY_POLICY**.

*  **""Read CND ' s summary of the German government-commissioned research that shows increases in cancer in children under five living near nuclear power stations .""** This sentence highlights health risks associated with nuclear power, pointing to **HEALTH_EFFECTS**. 

* **""Let ’s not exclude clean and safe nuclear energy .""**  This statement promotes nuclear power as a viable and safe energy source, suggesting concerns about **ACCIDENTS/SECURITY**.
