"You're asking me to code text examples for a research project about arguments surrounding marijuana legalization.  

That's interesting! I can definitely help with that. Here are the labels applied to each input, based on the provided codebook:


**Input:** In 2000 , there were six times as many emergency room mentions of marijuana use as there were in 1990 , despite the fact that the number of people using marijuana is roughly the same .
**Output:**  **HARM**

**Input:** In Australia , a study found that cannabis intoxication was responsible for 4.3 % of driver fatalities .
**Output:** **DRUG_ABUSE**

**Input:** Even smoking weed at home will allow the drug to make its way to others , especially if it is a multi-level apartment complex .
**Output:** **PERSONAL_FREEDOM** (This implies a debate about personal liberty vs. potential secondhand exposure)

**Input:** But through legalization , there will be open competition and lower prices , so drug cartels , which might include terrorists , would lose some or even all of their business .
**Output:** **ILLEGAL_TRADE**

**Input:** Even the gateway effect — the theory that cannabis leads to other drugs — was discarded long ago .
**Output:** **GATEWAY_DRUG**

**Input:** Statewide revenue from dedicated pot taxes easily topped the money from alcohol taxes .
**Output:** **NATIONAL_BUDGET** 

**Input:** Researchers at Harvard-affiliated McLean Hospital found members of a religious group regularly using peyote scored significantly better on several measures of overall mental health than did subjects who did not use the hallucinogen .
**Output:** **HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS**, **MEDICAL_MARIJUANA** (Peyote is often used in spiritual contexts, but can also be seen as having medicinal value)

**Input:** Anybody who ' s experienced it , actually been addicted to it , knows how profound that addiction is ... . The difficult thing about marijuana addiction is some people , even though they ' re addicted can do fine with it for many many years before they start to have difficultly , but eventually the high starts wearing off , people start smoking a lot more to try to get that high back and that ' s when they descend into difficulties .
**Output:** **ADDICTION** 

**Input:** A world where instead of drinking cheap beer , a hopeful political candidate can roll a joint to seem like the "" people ' s choice "" does n't have to seem crazy .
**Output:** **LEGAL_DRUGS**, **PERSONAL_FREEDOM** (Implies a shift in societal norms and acceptance)

**Input:** "" Students suck on lollipops between classes , go into class stoned , learn nothing , and teachers are increasingly helpless .
**Output:**  **CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY** 

**Input:** Others believe it helps in the treatment of depression .
**Output:** **MEDICAL_MARIJUANA**, **HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS** 

**Input:** Legalization of marijuana could eventually lead to the legalization of harder drugs or all drugs altogether .
**Output:** **DRUG_POLICY**

**Input:** The United Nations Office of Drugs and Crime has also acknowledged the many "" unintended negative consequences "" of drug enforcement .
**Output:** **COMMUNITY/SOCIATAL_EFFECTS**
