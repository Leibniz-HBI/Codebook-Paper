"Here's the output with labels applied, remember that sometimes multiple labels can apply. 

**Input:** After the president ' s speech , House Speaker John Boehner argued that raising the minimum wage would raise unemployment .
**Output:** UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE

**Input:** Translated out of econo-speak , that means that the price for labor is set artificially high , with more people willing to work than business will be able to hire .
**Output:** UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE

**Input:** According to the Economic Policy Institute , the minimum wage in the United States would have been $ 18.28 in 2013 if the minimum wage had kept pace with labor productivity .
**Output:** SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE

**Input:** Not only that , but as one of the law ’s proponents said in the hearings regarding the figure of 40 cents an hour that was being discussed at the time ( around $ 6.60 in 2015 dollars ) : “ it would be a calamity if such a wage minimum as that referred to should in any way be construed as a living wage . ”
**Output:** SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE

**Input:** Not true : Academic research has shown that higher wages sharply reduce employee turnover which can reduce employment and training costs .
**Output:** TURNOVER

**Input:** A higher minimum wage might also decrease turnover and thus keep training costs down , supporters say .
**Output:** TURNOVER

**Input:** If politicians want to increase the earned income tax credit or other work-related welfare benefits , they should do the hard work of building political support for such policies , rather than choosing the roundabout approach of a minimum wage increase .
**Output:** WELFARE

**Input:** Raising minimum wage means some of these people would be able to better support themselves without leaning as heavily on social programs and this would ultimately mean lower taxes or a reallocation of those funds to support other needs . 
**Output:** WELFARE

**Input:** Thus this price effect may harm the very people whom a minimum wage is supposed to help .
**Output:** PRICES

**Input:** The team found no measurable price hike at all at grocery stores , gas stations or retail outlets .
**Output:** PRICES

**Input:** The minimum wage will price the services of the least productive ( and therefore lowest-wage ) workers out of the market .
**Output:** LOW_SKILLED

**Input:** Companies can be more selective in those whom they employ thus the least skilled and least experienced will typically be excluded .
**Output:** LOW_SKILLED

**Input:** About 70 percent of minimum wage employees , however , work fewer than 35 hours per week and thus earn proportionately less , according to federal labor statistics .
**Output:** YOUTH_AND_SECONDARY_WAGE_EARNERS

**Input:** ✔ Low-wage earners make over half of their family ' s income , and 28 % of them have children .
**Output:** YOUTH_AND_SECONDARY_WAGE_EARNERS

**Input:** The movement for a minimum wage was initially focused on stopping sweatshop labor and controlling the proliferation of sweatshops in manufacturing industries .
 **Output:** CAPITAL_VS_LABOR

**Input:** A 2014 study by Alex Smith , PhD , Assistant Professor of Economics at the United States Military Academy at West Point , found that "" an increase in the minimum wage from $ 7.25 to $ 10.10 ( 39 % ) ... would lead to a 2-4 percentage point decrease in the likelihood that a low-SES [ socio-economic status ] teen will drop out . ""
**Output:** MOTIVATION/CHANCES


**Input:** Where does this leave job candidates who do n’t arrive readymade , with all the skills they need to climb the corporate ladder thanks to Mom , Dad , and good old Selective U . ?
 **Output:** MOTIVATION/CHANCES

**Input:** This knee - jerk response to look to the government to solve all of our problems is simply untenable and indefensible. 
**Output:** GOVERNMENT


**Input:** If someone wants to work for $ 5 an hour , and someone wants to hire that person for that much , and no one is forcing either one of them to enter into the agreement , by what authority does government step in and stop them ?
**Output:** GOVERNMENT

Let me explain why.  While a minimum wage might seem like it benefits all workers, it can weaken the bargaining power of unions.  Here's how:

* **Reduced Incentive to Unionize:** With a guaranteed minimum wage, some workers might feel less need to join a union to negotiate better wages.
* **Employer Pushback:** Employers facing higher labor costs due to the minimum wage may become more resistant to union demands for further increases or benefits.

"This is a great exercise! Here are the labels I'd assign to each input, keeping in mind that sometimes multiple labels apply:

**Input:** After the president ' s speech , House Speaker John Boehner argued that raising the minimum wage would raise unemployment .
**Output:** UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE

**Input:** Translated out of econo-speak , that means that the price for labor is set artificially high , with more people willing to work than business will be able to hire .
**Output:** UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE

**Input:** According to the Economic Policy Institute , the minimum wage in the United States would have been $ 18.28 in 2013 if the minimum wage had kept pace with labor productivity .
**Output:** SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE, ECONOMIC_IMPACT

**Input:** Not only that , but as one of the law ’s proponents said in the hearings regarding the figure of 40 cents an hour that was being discussed at the time ( around $ 6.60 in 2015 dollars ) : “ it would be a calamity if such a wage minimum as that referred to should in any way be construed as a living wage . ”
**Output:** SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE

**Input:** Not true : Academic research has shown that higher wages sharply reduce employee turnover which can reduce employment and training costs .
**Output:** TURNOVER

**Input:** A higher minimum wage might also decrease turnover and thus keep training costs down , supporters say .
**Output:** TURNOVER

**Input:** If politicians want to increase the earned income tax credit or other work-related welfare benefits , they should do the hard work of building political support for such policies , rather than choosing the roundabout approach of a minimum wage increase .
**Output:** WELFARE


**Input:** Raising minimum wage means some of these people would be able to better support themselves without leaning as heavily on social programs and this would ultimately mean lower taxes or a reallocation of those funds to support other needs .
**Output:** WELFARE

**Input:** Thus this price effect may harm the very people whom a minimum wage is supposed to help .
**Output:** PRICES

**Input:** The team found no measurable price hike at all at grocery stores , gas stations or retail outlets .
**Output:** PRICES 

**Input:** The minimum wage will price the services of the least productive ( and therefore lowest-wage ) workers out of the market .
**Output:** LOW-SKILLED

**Input:** Companies can be more selective in those whom they employ thus the least skilled and least experienced will typically be excluded .
**Output:** LOW-SKILLED

**Input:** About 70 percent of minimum wage employees , however , work fewer than 35 hours per week and thus earn proportionately less , according to federal labor statistics.
 **Output:** YOUTH_AND_SECONDARY_WAGE_EARNERS 

**Input:** ✔ Low-wage earners make over half of their family ' s income , and 28 % of them have children .
**Output:** YOUTH_AND_SECONDARY_WAGE_EARNERS 

**Input:** A 2014 study by Alex Smith , PhD , Assistant Professor of Economics at the United States Military Academy at West Point , found that "" an increase in the minimum wage from $ 7.25 to $ 10.10 ( 39 % ) ... would lead to a 2-4 percentage point decrease in the likelihood that a low-SES [ socio-economic status ] teen will drop out . ""
**Output:** MOTIVATION/CHANCES

 **Input:** Where does this leave job candidates who do n’t arrive readymade , with all the skills they need to climb the corporate ladder thanks to Mom , Dad , and good old Selective U . ?
**Output:** MOTIVATION/CHANCES

**Input:** This knee - jerk response to look to the government to solve all of our problems is simply untenable and indefensible. 
 **Output:** GOVERNMENT

"This task highlights an important aspect of social science research - coding qualitative data.  

Let me clarify a few points about the process and the codebook before we dive in:


* **Multiple Labels:** You're right, some sentences can and will likely have multiple labels. Think of it like categorizing a book; it might be fiction, romance, AND adventure all at once. 
* **Interpretation:** Coding is inherently interpretive. There might not always be a ""perfect"" fit, and disagreements are common. The key is to apply the codebook consistently and transparently.

Now, let's analyze those sentences:

**Input:**
After the president ' s speech , House Speaker John Boehner argued that raising the minimum wage would raise unemployment .
**Output:** UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE 

**Correct!** Boehner's argument directly connects raising the minimum wage to a potential increase in unemployment.

 **Input:**
Translated out of econo-speak , that means that the price for labor is set artificially high , with more people willing to work than business will be able to hire .
**Output:** UN/EMPLOYMENT_RATE

**Spot on!** This sentence elaborates on the mechanism by which a minimum wage increase could lead to unemployment.

 **Input:**
According to the Economic Policy Institute , the minimum wage in the United States would have been $ 18.28 in 2013 if the minimum wage had kept pace with labor productivity .
**Output:** SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE

**Excellent reasoning!**  This statement highlights a disparity between what workers could be earning and what they are currently earning, suggesting an issue of fairness.
