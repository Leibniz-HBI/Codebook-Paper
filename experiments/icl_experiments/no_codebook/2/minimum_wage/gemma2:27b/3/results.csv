"This example illustrates the challenges of coding qualitative data. While I can identify some clear matches based on the codebook, several examples highlight the ambiguity inherent in natural language. 

Here's a breakdown with explanations for some of the more complex cases:


**Ambiguous Cases:**

* **""If there is an increase in a minimum wage, it could have far-reaching effects on industries that do n't pay it.""**  While this touches on COMPETITION/BUSINESS_CHALLENGES, it also implies ECONOMIC_IMPACT. It's debatable which label is more prominent.
* **""That last argument is underscored by the exorbitant salaries earned by CEOs and other corporate titans, which are also the same people generally arguing against an increase in the minimum wage.""** This strongly suggests CAPITAL_VS_LABOR, but there's an underlying ECONOMIC_IMPACT argument as well (high CEO pay vs. low worker wages).

* **""Where does this leave job candidates who do n’t arrive readymade , with all the skills they need to climb the corporate ladder thanks to Mom , Dad , and good old Selective U . ?""** This leans towards MOTIVATION/CHANCES, but also hints at SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE depending on interpretation.

 **Considerations for Coding:**


* **Context Matters:**  Sentences should be analyzed in the context of the surrounding text. A single sentence might not fully reveal its intended meaning.
* **Multiple Labels:** Be prepared to assign multiple labels when appropriate. Many arguments are complex and touch on several aspects.
* **Subjectivity:** Coding qualitative data inherently involves some degree of subjectivity. Clear guidelines and discussion among coders can help ensure consistency.
