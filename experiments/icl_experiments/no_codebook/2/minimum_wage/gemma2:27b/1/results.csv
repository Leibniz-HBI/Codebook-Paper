Let me explain why:

* **SOCIAL_JUSTICE/INJUSTICE**: The statement highlights the historical context of the minimum wage, suggesting it was intended to address unfair labor practices.  Comparing the 1968 minimum wage to its present-day equivalent implies a concern for fair wages and worker well-being.
* **ECONOMIC_IMPACT**: Mentioning the real value of the 1968 minimum wage in today's terms directly relates to the economic impact of the minimum wage over time. It invites reflection on how inflation and economic changes affect the purchasing power of wages.
