**Explanation of Coding Decisions:**

This codebook focuses on the arguments for and against marijuana legalization. It's important to remember that sometimes multiple labels can apply to a single statement. Here's a breakdown of why I chose the labels I did:


* **PERSONAL_FREEDOM:** Statements emphasizing individual choice and autonomy in using marijuana fall under this label.

* **DRUG_POLICY:** This label applies to discussions about the legal framework surrounding marijuana, including regulation, taxation, and potential decriminalization.

* **GATEWAY_DRUG:**  Statements debating whether marijuana use leads to harder drug use are coded with this label.

* **ADDICTION:** Discussions about the addictive nature of marijuana, its effects on users, and withdrawal symptoms fall under this category. 

* **HEALTH/PSYCHOLOGICAL_EFFECTS:** This label encompasses statements discussing both positive (e.g., creativity, mental health benefits) and negative (e.g., impairment) psychological impacts of marijuana use.

* **ILLEGAL_TRADE:** Statements addressing the black market for marijuana, drug cartels, and the potential impact of legalization on these entities are coded accordingly.

* **MEDICAL_MARIJUANA:** This label is used for statements discussing marijuana's therapeutic uses for treating medical conditions. 

* **COMMUNITY/SOCIETAL_EFFECTS:**  Broader impacts of marijuana legalization or prohibition on society, such as crime rates, public health, and cultural attitudes are coded here.

* **DRUG_ABUSE:** Statements focusing on the potential for misuse, impairment while under the influence, and negative consequences of excessive marijuana use fall under this label.

* **NATIONAL_BUDGET:** Discussions about the economic implications of legalization, including tax revenue and law enforcement costs, are coded with this label.

* **LEGAL_DRUGS:** This label is applied to statements arguing for the normalization and legal status of marijuana, comparing it to other legal substances like alcohol or tobacco.

* **CHILD_AND_TEEN_SAFETY:** Statements addressing the concerns about youth access to marijuana and its potential impact on development are coded here. 
* **HARM:**  Statements explicitly discussing the negative consequences or dangers associated with marijuana use, regardless of the specific type of harm (health, social, etc.) are labeled as HARM.
