**Input:** Read CND ' s summary of the German government-commissioned research that shows increases in cancer in children under five living near nuclear power stations .

**Output:** HEALTH_EFFECTS 
*This sentence focuses on potential health consequences (cancer) linked to proximity to nuclear power plants.*

**Input:** The accident at [ TMI-2 ] has already impaired the health and sense of well being of these individuals , as evidenced by their feelings of increased anxiety , tension and fear , a sense of helplessness and such physical disorders as skin rashes , aggravated ulcers , and skeletal and muscular problems .
**Output:** HEALTH_EFFECTS
*This text directly describes negative health effects (physical and psychological) experienced after a nuclear accident.*

**Input:** Let ‚Äôs not exclude clean and safe nuclear energy .
**Output:** ACCIDENTS/SECURITY 
*While advocating for nuclear energy, the phrase ""clean and safe"" implies addressing concerns about accidents and security, which are central debates surrounding nuclear power.*

**Input:** In the light of the twin towers atrocity this is a completely unacceptable risk .
**Output:** ACCIDENTS/SECURITY
*This sentence explicitly links the risk of nuclear power to terrorism (as symbolized by the 9/11 attacks), highlighting security concerns.*

**Input:** It remains up to nuclear and renewable energies to fill the gap .
**Output:** RENEWABLES
* This statement positions renewable energy sources as alternatives, suggesting a comparison with nuclear energy in filling an energy need. *


**Input:** [ ... ] Renewable energy , on the other hand , is the cleanest , safest and most reliable form of power generation . ""

**Output:** RENEWABLES

*This sentence explicitly praises renewable energy for its positive attributes (cleanest, safest, most reliable) compared to other forms of energy production.*


**Input:** The U.S. department that would be in charge of such an operation is the same one that brought us the chaotic and ineffective evacuation of the much smaller city of New Orleans during the 2005 Hurricane Katrina debacle : the Department of Homeland Security .

 **Output:** ENERGY_POLICY
* This passage critiques the capability of a government agency (Department of Homeland Security) responsible for managing nuclear emergencies, implying concerns about energy policy and its execution.*



**Input:** Consequently , the government has to subsidize the costs .
**Output:** ENERGY_POLICY
* This sentence points to the need for governmental intervention (subsidies) in the cost structure of an energy source, indicating an aspect of energy policy.*

**Input:** ‚Äú Nuclear power is not a near-term solution to the challenge of climate change , ‚Äù writes Sharon Squassoni in the IAEA bulletin .

 **Output:** ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT
*This statement directly addresses nuclear power's role (or lack thereof) in mitigating climate change, a major environmental concern.*


**Input:** But nuclear energy is n't really a zero-carbon system , since you still have to manufacture power plants , mine and enrich uranium , and transport processed fuel√¢ ‚Ç¨ ‚Äù all of which typically rely on CO2-emitting fuel sources .

 **Output:** ENVIRONMENTAL_IMPACT
*This sentence highlights the carbon footprint associated with various stages of the nuclear fuel cycle, emphasizing its environmental impact.*


**Input:** Wastes are contained and managed , not released . 

 **Output:** WASTE
* This statement focuses on the handling and management of nuclear waste, a key aspect of the debate surrounding nuclear energy. *



 **Input:** Whenever nuclear waste is buried , risks are created for future generations , as there is no 100 % reliable way to store radioactive materials .

 **Output:** WASTE

*This passage discusses the long-term dangers and challenges associated with storing nuclear waste, further emphasizing the WASTE label.*


**Input:** Replacing coal to limit global warming should not be based on another toxic product .
 **Output:** FOSSIL FUELS
* This statement implies a comparison between nuclear energy and fossil fuels (coal) as sources of energy, suggesting that nuclear power might be seen as a less desirable alternative due to its potential toxicity.*

**Input:** How long can we expect supplies of Uranium and nuclear energy to last ?
 **Output:** RELIABILITY
*This question directly addresses the availability and longevity of uranium fuel, a key factor influencing the reliability of nuclear energy.*
