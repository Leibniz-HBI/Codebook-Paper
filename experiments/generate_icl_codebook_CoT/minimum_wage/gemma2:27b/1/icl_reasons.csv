This suggests a challenge for businesses to balance profitability with employee compensation. Therefore, the correct label is `COMPETITION/BUSINESS_CHALLENGES`. "
It is commonly argued that raising the minimum wage will hurt businesses by making them less profitable and decreasing their value to shareholders .,COMPETITION/BUSINESS_CHALLENGES,"Let's break down why the label **COMPETITION/BUSINESS_CHALLENGES** is appropriate for the given text. 1. **Focus on Business Impact:** The sentence centers on the consequences of raising the minimum wage for businesses. 2. **Profitability and Value:** It specifically mentions decreased profitability and lowered value to shareholders, which are key concerns within the realm of business challenges. 3. **Alignment with Codebook:** These concerns align directly with the **COMPETITION/BUSINESS_CHALLENGES** category as outlined in the codebook: * ""How a minimum wage affects the competition between businesses"" * ""Businesses have to close because they cannot afford to pay minimum wage"" * ""Businesses see a shrinking profit margin or become unprofitable due to minimum wage"" Therefore, the correct label is **COMPETITION/BUSINESS_CHALLENGES**.

"About 70 percent of minimum wage employees , however , work fewer than 35 hours per week and thus earn proportionately less , according to federal labor statistics .",YOUTH_AND_SECONDARY_WAGE_EARNERS,"Let's break down the reasoning for labeling the text as `YOUTH_AND_SECONDARY_WAGE_EARNERS`. 1. **Focus on Hours Worked:** The sentence highlights that ""About 70 percent of minimum wage employees... work fewer than 35 hours per week."" This is a key indicator often associated with part-time employment. 2. **Proportionately Less Earnings:** The phrase ""and thus earn proportionately less"" reinforces the idea that these workers are likely not relying on their minimum wage job as their primary source of income. 3. **Federal Labor Statistics:** The reference to ""federal labor statistics"" suggests a broader analysis of employment patterns, which often differentiate between full-time and part-time workers. These points collectively point towards a workforce segment that is more characteristic of `YOUTH_AND_SECONDARY_WAGE_EARNERS` - individuals who might be working part-time jobs for supplemental income or experience rather than as their primary means of support. Therefore, the correct label is `YOUTH_AND_SECONDARY_WAGE_EARNERS`. "
"✔ Low-wage earners make over half of their family ' s income , and 28 % of them have children .",YOUTH_AND_SECONDARY_WAGE_EARNERS,"Let's break down why the label **YOUTH_AND_SECONDARY_WAGE_EARNERS** is appropriate for the text: * **Focus on Income:** The sentence highlights that ""Low-wage earners make over half of their family's income."" This suggests these individuals are likely contributing significantly to household finances, but not necessarily as primary breadwinners. * **Prevalence of Children:** The statement ""28% of them have children"" further supports the idea that these are not teenagers seeking part-time work. Adults with dependents are more likely to be relying on their wages for essential family needs. * **Distinction from LOW-SKILLED:** While some low-wage earners might fall into the ""low-skilled"" category, the text's emphasis on familial reliance and the presence of children points towards individuals who are working to support their families rather than just entering the workforce.

This aligns directly with the definition of ""YOUTH_AND_SECONDARY_WAGE_EARNERS"" which includes mentions of part-time workers. 2. **Income Not Primary Support:** The phrase ""...and people aren't relying on it to actually support a household"" further strengthens the label. This implies that the minimum wage earners being discussed are not using their wages as the main source of income for themselves or a family, which is characteristic of secondary wage earners (like students working part-time) or teenagers seeking extra money.

They are likely adults relying on minimum wage jobs for primary income. Therefore, the correct label is **YOUTH_AND_SECONDARY_WAGE_EARNERS**."
This excuse for keeping a low minimum wage is similar to the “ they ’re just teenagers ” argument .,YOUTH_AND_SECONDARY_WAGE_EARNERS,"Let's break down why the label **YOUTH_AND_SECONDARY_WAGE_EARNERS** is appropriate for this text: 1. **""excuse for keeping a low minimum wage""**: This phrase suggests the text is discussing arguments against raising the minimum wage. 2. **""similar to the “they’re just teenagers” argument""**: This directly compares the reasoning used to justify a low minimum wage to an argument specifically about teenagers. The codebook defines **YOUTH_AND_SECONDARY_WAGE_EARNERS** as encompassing mentions of: * Teenagers who want to earn extra money * Part-time workers * Workers not earning a primary household income Since the text draws a parallel between arguments for a low minimum wage and those specifically targeting teenagers, it aligns with the definition of **YOUTH_AND_SECONDARY_WAGE_EARNERS**.

This phrase directly addresses the concept of a ""living wage"" - a central theme within the `SOCIAL JUSTICE/INJUSTICE` category. 2. **Implied Argument:** The text implies that the proposed minimum wage, even at 40 cents an hour (equivalent to $6.60 in 2015), is insufficient to be considered a ""living wage."" This suggests a concern about the fairness of worker compensation and the ability of workers to meet their basic needs. 3. **Codebook Alignment:** The codebook explicitly mentions ""living wage,"" ""living costs [costs must be covered! good effect for workers],"" ""social justice,"" and ""dignity"" as aspects falling under `SOCIAL JUSTICE/INJUSTICE`. The text's focus on the inadequacy of the proposed minimum wage in relation to a ""living wage"" aligns directly with these codebook entries.
